# Readme
This is the public repository for the website [jache.re](https://jache.re).

For now la jachère is a collaboratively edited archive of work in progress thoughts as well as texts. Other formats and aspects might arise at another time.

La jachère runs on a Raspberry Pi[^1] in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland, and is stewarded by [thgie.ch](https://thgie.ch). More information on the deployment process of this website can be found under [Jachere Deployment and Publishing](notes/Jachere%20Deployment%20and%20Publishing.md).
