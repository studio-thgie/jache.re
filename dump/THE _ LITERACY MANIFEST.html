        <ul>
        <li>literacy is necessary for a functioning society in the modern age. * literacy is not * education. A person educated in * can understand <em>. A</em> literate person can do <em>.</em> literacy empowers everyone who possesses it to be active contributors to their own life and society as whole.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The * literacy suffers from a monoculture, and it is diversity that <em>ists seek to achieve. We assert that the right of freedom of inquiry, to do</em> research and pursue understanding under oneâ€™s own direction, is a fundamental right.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>research requires tools. We the <em>ists are dedicated to putting the tools of</em> investigation into the hands of anyone who wants them. We are building an infrastructure of methodology, of communication and of publicly available knowledge. As <em>ists it is our responsibility to act as emissaries of</em> , creating new *ists out of everyone we meet. We communicate not only the value of our research, but the value of our methodology and motivation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>ists take responsibility for their research. We keep in mind that our subjects of interest are dynamic systems worthy of respect and good treatment, and we are acutely aware that our research affects those around us.</em> ists engage in their * research with a critical mind, astonishment and a pinch of humour.</p>
        <p>The *ists are actively engaged in making the world a place that everyone can understand. Come, let us research together.</p>
