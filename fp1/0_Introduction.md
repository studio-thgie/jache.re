# Introduction
This is the first Fallow Zine, a small zine that sprang forth from La Jachère. This zine is basically a simple attempt to think collaboratively about subjects that the Jachère/Fallow/Brache project concerns itself with. If you are interest to know what these are, please have a look at the [about](about.md) page. 

## Lazy tech or tech for the lazies
That is the theme for this issue. If you are interested, there was a [call for entries](notes/call-fallow-zine-1.md) that is a bit more detailed.

I had the impression, that lately we got technology all wrong. Technology should make life easier, no? Instead, we get technology abound with making everybodies (peoples, plants, animals, planets and other things) more complex, more difficult, and definitly less fun. Easier lifes are not achieved by technology, but by capital, as usual.

The initial goal of this zine was an attempt to paint a different idea of technolgoy, or dream a different dream of what technology could be, provide a different starting point or vocabulary to talk about technology. Since this idea only existed in my head, more or less, I was very surprised how others interpreted the [call for entries](notes/call-fallow-zine-1.md).

A good chunk of it occupies itself to different degrees with the refusal of technology, the minimisation of it, not unlike the [luddites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite). It's not about being anti-technology, but about drawing the line and stating, that we actually have more then enough technology already.

So let's do that for now, ok? Get yourself comfy, and let us collaboratively refuse the onslaught of technology. Have a tea, eat some cookies, enjoy the moment. Here is what's in for you in this issue.
