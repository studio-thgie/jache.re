# Humane technology
By [Boris Marinov](https://boris-marinov.github.io/).

It is a well-known engineering principle, that you should always use the _weakest_ technology capable of solving your problem - the weakest technology is likely the cheapest, easiest to maintain, extend or replace and there are no sane arguments for using anything else.

We can argue that this is the principle behind the evolutionary process that designed _us_ human beings - evolution always starts from rudimentary and the weak and then, only if needed, it proceeds towards greater strength and complexity.

Technologies (as Marshal McLuhan theorized) can be perceived as _extensions of our bodies and minds_. Like, a pair of binoculars can be thought as an organ that extends our vision with additional lenses. And the written word is nothing more than an extension of our ability to talk and memorize. Technologies that embrace this view with all it’s implications are what I call _humane technologies_ and they are the subject of this book. My main thesis is that they have many advantages over technologies that focus too much on superficial criteria and ignore these principles (AKA _non-humane technologies_.)

# Humane technologies _solve problems in ways that don’t create other problems_.

Inhumane technologies sometimes leaves us at a state where we have to _remind ourselves why exactly do we use them_. Yes, they benefit us in some ways, but these benefits always come with a cost which seems almost equal to the benefits.

This dilemma doesn’t exist with humane technologies - _we know exactly why we use them_ and their disadvantages always seem superficial, compared to their advantages.

# Humane technologies _leave the user in control_.

Whether they are broken, or operating as intended, inhumane technologies often _look like they have a will of their own_ and they often surprise you unpleasantly. With human technologies, on the contrary, _you always know exactly what is gonna happen_. And in case there is a problem, you often know what the issue is and how to fix it. Humane technologies are not black boxes.

# Humane technologies _are timeless_.

Because they are often a result of a compromise, inhumane technologies are _bound to have a due date_ - a time when some other alternative would prove to be more performat. Inhumane technologies tend to go out of fashion. Human technologies, on the other hand, are often ancient (due to their simplicity), and at the same time, due to their versatility, eternal.

# Humane technologies _are fulfilling to use_.

An inhumane technology is something that you _pick up to “do your job” and leave it as soon as you are done_, wondering when is a better alternative coming out. They are designed with a specific purpose in mind and they have no other uses. A humane technology often has a variety of purposes (with more to be discovered). We use them for more and more things, because using them feels good. We either cannot imagine our lives without them (if we have used them since birth), or _bless the day we found them_.

# Humane technologies _are unimpressive_

Inhumane technologies often _look better than humane ones_, especially to the untrained eye - they are so shiny, so innovative, they look like they bring the promise of a better future. Compared to them, humane technologies _seem plain and uninteresting_. However, all that changes when we put things in perspective.
