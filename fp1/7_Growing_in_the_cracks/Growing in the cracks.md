# Growing in the cracks

> I have been developing a series of drawings and photographs that are looking at the moments between human built space, where plants have taken root and are growing. This is part of a larger project about liminal spaces and thresholds, which is ongoing. I have not written anything up on this yet, as a lot of the process is still fermenting, but I wanted to submit the images as they might have some visual use/identity and I like the idea of your project of fallow-ness. If they are not a fit/not selected then that is completely understandable and I welcome comment â€“ I see these as works in progress and not as completed ideas.
