        <p>By <a href="https://www.shanefinan.org/">Shane Finan</a> All
        photos and illustrations (c) by Shane Finan</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I have been developing a series of drawings and photographs
        that are looking at the moments between human built space, where
        plants have taken root and are growing. This is part of a larger
        project about liminal spaces and thresholds, which is ongoing. I
        have not written anything up on this yet, as a lot of the
        process is still fermenting, but I wanted to submit the images
        as they might have some visual use/identity and I like the idea
        of your project of fallow-ness. If they are not a fit/not
        selected then that is completely understandable and I welcome
        comment â€“ I see these as works in progress and not as completed
        ideas.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That was the general idea Shane approached me with. We
        discussed some ways of letting the illustrations growing out of
        cracks in the finished zine. But that might be a thing for an
        enhanced version of this issue ðŸ˜… and who knows when that will
        happenâ€¦ (sorry Shane!)</p>
        <p>I love the idea of looking at how our human infrastructures
        are taken over by flora when we are not constantly combat those
        beautiful plants.</p>
