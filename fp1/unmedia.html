        <p>By <a href="https://write.as/tmo/">TMO</a></p>
        <p>General peace and distraction-free living by self-imposed
        media abstinence</p>
        <p>In late-2019 I “stopped” with media. A fair deal of it - I
        closed the last two social media accounts I had (Twitter and
        Instagram), I stopped checking up on CNN here in The States, I
        stopped looking for news recommendations from other RSS sources.
        I just stopped ALL of it. It turned out to be a good time to
        turn away from media consumption, too, because the COVID-19
        pandemic was just around the corner (not that anyone saw
        <em>that</em> coming).</p>
        <p>But, when I began my longterm media sabbatical (it has been 2
        1/2 years now with very little media consumption, besides a few
        headlines here and there, and still no social media), I decided
        to write about <em>how it was going</em> by avoiding news,
        social media, and other outlets of information. And that is
        where <strong>“Unmedia”</strong> came into play.</p>
        <p>In this article I address the very real, but very unnecessary
        trepidation people experience with Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO),
        discuss a few small hiatus’ I took from the Internet pre-media
        abstinence, how deciding to remove the mass media (social or
        otherwise) consumption from my life was the “correct answer” for
        me to “heal” and for me to regain my bearings, and how I spend
        my time now that I am not in “Consumption Mode” 24 hours a
        day.</p>
        <p>As time went on (and as I documented in the article), I saw
        that media was much more than just a passive way to kill off
        some time - it was, in fact, an addiction. The prolonged hours
        of boredom (that never get “replaced”, just “dealt with” and
        consolidated in a different (and more healthy) way), and to use
        one quote from the article:</p>
        <p><em>Boredom is like a mantlepiece for how time is spent –
        make use of it, BUILD with it, DO with it, or let it be a
        crushing hurdle in life when it is not managed
        properly.</em></p>
        <p>I also address elements of the addictive properties OF social
        media sites, and CHOOSING to (re-)prioritize how I spend my
        time, and how by staying away from bad news has improved my
        outlook and approach to life, and how I am going to
        <em>stay</em> away from media consumption for the foreseeable
        (and unforeseeable) future.</p>
        <p>The index for <strong>“Unmedia”</strong> is below. About
        2,100 words, cut into seven sections:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><code>Out Of Touch (with world happenings)</code></li>
        <li><code>Good information. Bad information. True information. False information. No information</code></li>
        <li><code>Amusing Yourself, or, Becoming Anti-Bored</code></li>
