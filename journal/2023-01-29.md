# End of Month Post: January 2023
Maybe this format sticks, perhaps not. I like the thought of looking back a short period of time, and catalog what was, what happened, what was done. I don't want to use this to show off what great projects I did, but have it a bit more on the personal side. We're all human, aren't we?

- had an actual week of holidays, which I actually used to relax and get bored
- did a dry and sugarless vegetanuary (not vegan, but vegetarian)
- had my last "regular" month as scientific software developer in one project, and became melancholic about it
- started to be excited about my "new" position as PhD student in a new project
- live together and took care of a pair of parrots, and enjoyed my time with the hellbirds
- almost finished the essential reading "Die Erschöpfung der Frauen" und wrote a brief review on [my bookwyrms account](https://wyrms.de/user/thgie/review/33010/s/unverzichtbare-lekture-zu-feministischen-diskursen-und-dem-status-quo-der-frauen#anchor-33010)
- was more social than usual, or so I have the feeling. Met quite a few of my folks
- the [Isopod colonies](notes/Isopod%20colonies.md) developed wonderfully. The P. ornatus are just a sassy bunch, multiplying as hell. The older A. klugii are dying off slowly, maybe one a week or so. The kiddos dig into the substrate and hardly every visible. But I guess I counted around 8 or so newcomers
- did one of the most fantastic breads in my baking-career, and recorded it's recipe here: [70% Hydration, no fold sourdough](notes/Baking.md#hydration-no-fold-sourdough)

My guiding mantra for 2023 is profound boredom[^1]. All in all I had the feeling I was able to take time for this and the transition between jobs.

I also went to have a neuropsychological evaluation with a professional. The reason being that at times, it's close to impossible for me to stay focused or concentrated. I'm not talking about procrastination here. It's about ADHD level of forgetting what I was told, racing thoughts, unable to read a sentence because the text is quick flowing lava, and at times I suffer. The evaluation should bring a bit of clearance, what I could work on. Results next month :)
