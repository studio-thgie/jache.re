        and <a href="notes/Reading%20Practice.html">Reading
        Practice</a></h1>
        <p>I’ve been busy with being part of a new research project, as
        well as starting with my studies. I have to gather some more
        ECTS points to do my PhD. Luckily, these days, I can do that
        during my studies. It also means that I have to read a lot. I’ve
        been diagnosed with a mild ADHD (and a resulting anxiety), which
        helped me contextualize certain problems I had during my
        Master’s studies.</p>
        <p>In the following, I’d love to hold on to some thoughts on how
        I deal with having problems concentrating and being easily
        distracted and having to read complex material. Maybe it might
        help somebody else when dealing with similar issues. That said,
        in the end you’ve got to find what works for you.</p>
        <h2 id="fml">fml…</h2>
        <p>I have two main issues when reading material for studies or
        work:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Problems reading</li>
        <li>Problems recalling</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="during-reading">During reading</h3>
        <p>Although the following graphic illustrates something else,
        this is an <em>accurate</em> (…) depiction of how reading feels
        at times. My eyes start to speed up, and in a frantic and
        chaotic manner jump all over the text. It’s tough to build up a
        coherent understanding of the text when this happens.</p>
        <figure>
        <img src="assets/Pasted%20image%2020230306111258.png"

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Illustration of search paths in
        visual and semantic spaces</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Another problem is that my thoughts wander off pretty quickly
        after a few sentences or paragraphs. Sometimes I catch myself
        how I was reading several sentences and have no actual
        recollection of doing so. Instead, a few moments ago, I was
        forking of in my mind and following my own thread. Finally,
        sometimes the reading feels like such a burden that I can’t even
        start, no matter how much I try. When I’m blocked like this, I
        experience it quite physical, having a bodily aversion to the
        chores ahead. I usually end up doing something else instead,
        like cleaning. If I nonetheless try to read a paragraph, it
        feels violent.</p>
        <p>I can’t say that I found strategies to combat these problems,
        but over the last few years I was able to practice some stuff.
        Some notes on that:</p>
        <ol start="0" type="1">
        <li><strong>Generally taking care of yourself.</strong> It
        helps, really. Don’t drink too much coffee. Sleep according to
        your needs. Eat regularly and healthy. Don’t even try to be
        productive before you didn’t attend to yourself.</li>
        <li>Shouldn’t need any mentioning, but here we go: <strong>All
        notifications off!</strong> Smartphone out of reach. Music only
        if it helps you stay focused. Take a few deep breath, and dive
        into the text. By the way, breathing helps me a lot. Sometimes I
        get really stressed by fearing I’m loosing it during reading, a
        quick break and some deep breathing is great.</li>
        <li><strong>Some days are different from others.</strong>
        Sometimes nothing helps and it’s best not to force it. I usually
        try to have an overview of how much reading I <em>can</em> and
        <em>have</em> to do until the deadline. I also try to do my
        reading-chores as soon as possible. Usually, the reading takes
        longer than expected, or it doesn’t work out at all. Like this,
        I can postpone reading into later slots, without breaking out
        into anxiety.</li>
        <li><strong>Chunks.</strong> To stay on track with what I’m
        currently reading, I try to chunk up the texts into what works
        for me at that particular moment. I have a look at the length
        and intensity of the paper or chapter, estimate total reading
        time and break it down to how many paragraphs, pages or minutes
        I can read at a time. Sometimes that’s just 5–10 minutes or a
        page or a few paragraphs before having to have a quick break.
        Fuck pomodoro, 25 minutes is far too long to stay
        concentrated.</li>
        <li><strong>Making notes during reading.</strong> This one is
        super important for me personally, since it also helps with the
        second problem, recalling what I read. I only read digital.
        Analogue, as in on paper, would be more pleasant, but I can’t
        find a workflow that works for me. Making notes during reading
        helps me chunk up the reading as well as stay present, as in,
        not wandering off in my mind. I do annotations, but they usually
        don’t help me that much. I have to rephrase and contextualize
        what I’m reading. In this process, Zotero helps me a lot. I
        wrote about my setup in <a
        href="notes/Research%20and%20writing%20workflow.html">Research and
        writing workflow</a>. The inbuilt editor enables me to pull
        annotations from the text and then write my own thoughts.</li>
        <li>There is a generall approach for reading scientific papers
        and book chapters, <a
        href="https://resources.nu.edu/researchprocess/readingscientificarticle">as
        outlined by the National University Library</a>. In skimming you
        just read the most important parts of a text first. I usually do
        that with longer texts, by going over every paragraph and read
        the first and/or last sentence. I have problems keeping the
        whole text present, so skimming helps me getting a general
        comprehension of it. It also puts me at easy, because I might
        lose some details, but I nonetheless know what the text
        generally wanted to transport.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="recalling-what-i-read">Recalling what I read</h2>
        <p>General rule of thumb: If I didn’t write it down, chances are
        it’s lost to serendipity. Which would be OK if I didn’t need to
        recall purposely. But, no…</p>
        <ol start="0" type="1">
        <li><strong>Making notes during reading.</strong> I try to make
        notes in a way, so they rephrase what I’m reading in a more
        condensed way. I try to make notes that contain more of my own
        thoughts than annotations I copied. With scientific papers, I
        often copy parts of the abstract or introduction and the
        conclusion. They usually contain the most important parts of a
        paper. The stuff in between is if you want to understand the
        theory, practice or process of how they arrived at the
        conclusion.</li>
        <li><strong>Glossaries.</strong> If I’m working within a larger
        context, such as a research project or a seminar, I maintain a
        glossary. In almost every text I read, I encounter key terms or
        difficult concepts. Those go at the bottom of my reading note
        and then straight into my <a
        href="notes/Personal%20Knowledge%20Management.html">Personal
        Knowledge Management</a> systems, which are usually a kind of
        wiki. Have a look at the <a
        href="https://dissertation.thgie.ch/notes/Glossary.html">glossary
        for my dissertation</a>. It contains terms I encountered, some
        of them expanded, some not.</li>
        <li><strong>Second round!</strong> The second round is probably
        the most important step to prepare my notes for reading. In one
        form or another, I need to revisit what I’ve read. Glossaries
        are one way to do that, <a
        href="https://dissertation.thgie.ch/notes/Journal.html">journals</a>
        another. Sometimes, a concept is so important, that I create a
        page/note just for that. You see that with the glossary terms I
        expanded upon. Just go over the reading notes, see if something
        deserves its own note, and try to briefly summarize the most
        important aspects of what you’ve read.</li>
        <li><strong>Linking.</strong> The second round enables me to
        weave everything into a tight web of knowledge. I use Obsidian
        as my Zettelkasten software. The application allows me to import
        my reading notes from Zotero and hypothes.is. When doing a new
        entry in my Zettelkasten, I can then link to the document
        holding my reading notes. So, a journal entry might mention some
        reading notes as sources, and lets me link to newly expanded
        terms in the glossary.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice.</strong> I suck at this, but that leaves
        room for improvement. My notes and wikis these days look and
        feel much better than what I produced before. Nobody, least me,
        is born to do this. It’s important to keep in mind that reading
        and writing are things that we can learn, but have to practice
        to do so.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The end product is super condensed, but it enables me to
        follow the <strong>breadcrumbs</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>From a journal entry or note</li>
        <li>to the glossary terms and reading notes</li>
        <li>and finally jumping into the original document in Zotero or
        hypothes.is</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It sounds like a lot of work, but the <strong>second
        round</strong> and the <strong>linking</strong> don’t take up
        much time, compared to the reading part… and it’s definitely
        worth it for me. Now, <a
        href="notes/Writing%20Practice.html">writing</a> is a whole other
        story.</p>
