# Spring appreciation and catching up post
Time flies, but I should also not hold myself too accountable to a journal. I don't owe you anything, mere blog, but mutual respect. I'm not sure what I already talked about and what not, so here is a rough list of things that might have happened.

## Bespoke list
- We worked on an initial list of video games from the German-speaking countries, developed until the year 2000. [More about that on our research's Mastodon account](https://hcommons.social/@chludens/110139174847029433).
- I started to mend the[ Swiss part of that list into Wikidata](https://w.wiki/6UEP). So, I became a member of the [Wikidata Video Game Project](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Wikidata:WikiProject_Video_games) and fiddled around with [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/). [Cleaning up the data, reconciling it with existing Wikidata and building up the schema](https://media.ed.ac.uk/media/OpenRefine+Beginners+Tutorial/0_y5bxsswq) before importing felt like magic, but also partially messy.
- We worked on a post on an analysis on [Ball Raider](https://hol.abime.net/20) for our [research project's blog](https://chludens.hypotheses.org/). More to come soon.
- I'm still [working on my dissertations focus](https://dissertation.thgie.ch/journal/2023-03-31.html). It's not much for now, but it's something I can work with and develop further.
- For my [course on multimodal approaches to more-than-human anthropology](notes/Exploring%20Human%20and%20More-than-Human%20Relationships.md) I'm starting to work on a piece on the beaver that lives nearby and that I'm obsessed with.
- Besides that, [a lot of my energy and time goes into readings](journal/2023-03-06.md) for the courses I take at the university. I'm honestly looking forward to got the needed credits.
- I got a [new isopod colony](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpcT0i_K6Q7/) (third slide). They're Cubaris spec. "Lemon Blue" and they are the cutest! 
- Gardening season has begun! [I made tons of new friends in the soil](https://www.instagram.com/p/CqNt-xEq5wz/). Reminds me I should continue reading that Teaming with Microbes book…

That should suffice for now. Here is a list of music and films that I recommend.

- [EO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EO_(film)), this is like one of the saddest films ever :(
- [Sound and Silence](https://www.soundandsilence-film.ch/), beautiful, gentle film about an old Japanese punk couple
- [notes for les sanglières by Elsa Brés](https://vimeo.com/618811818), watched this in the more-than-human course and love the board/politics crossover
- [Cold Mountain by Dhyana](https://dhyanadoom.bandcamp.com/album/cold-mountain), Ambient doom drone sludge? Hell yes!
- [UGLY by slowthai](https://slowthai.bandcamp.com/album/ugly), the new slowthai album is beautiful and rich
- [startup tune feat. nuphory by nuphory & Pizza Hotline](https://pizzahotline.bandcamp.com/track/startup-tune-feat-nuphory), although pretty basic, obsessed by the sonic aesthetics of this 
- [Lost Control by Benedikt Frey](https://emotional-response.bandcamp.com/album/lost-control), also obsessed by this, sad it's just one track. Weird it runs under electronic, sounds more like new wave post-punk.
- [sudno (Boris Ryzhy) from etazhi (2018) by Molchat Doma](https://domamolchat.bandcamp.com/track/sudno-boris-ryzhy), this song dominated darker TikToks for a while, a year or two ago. can't get rid of it… great song to get wasted to
