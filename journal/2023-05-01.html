        <p>Labour Day, labour month?</p>
        <p>I had a brief moment this month, where I broke out in panic.
        Now, that the study semester is heading towards its end, it’s
        also time to talk about deliverables. Most of the workload will
        hit me in May, some of it in June. When trying to organize the
        workload, <a
        href="https://www.additudemag.com/what-is-executive-function-disorder/">executive
        dysfunction</a> kicked and some of the usual symptoms appeared.
        Like wanting to learn another language on top of everything, or
        frantically researching better way to manage tasks and move
        <em>e v e r y t h i n g</em> to a new software or platform.</p>
        <p>It worked out in the end – found some ways to manage
        long-term tasks by setting the deadline, creating an overview
        per month, then and asses time budget per week and finally know
        what has to be done when. ==I’d love to have a system where I
        can easily zoom between quarter, month, multi-week, week and day
        and always have the relevant information in view.==</p>
        <p>Plenty of other things happened during April. But the month
        went so quickly that I have the feeling most of it was much
        longer ago. It was Eastern, for example! I visited my family and
        we had a good time. Or I was moderating a workshop on the <a
        href="https://www.hd.unibe.ch/kurse___tagungen/kilof_tagung/index_ger.html">Interactive
        Language Models Days</a> of the University of Bern. Some
        interesting convos happened.</p>
        <p>I started to work on a paper for a disk-book, which is a
        book, but on a disk… It will be openable on a <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore
        64</a> (or an online emulator for that mater), and is organized
        by the <a href="http://dhspiele.de/">AG Spiele</a>. My
        contribution will be about a critical reading of the source code
        of the <a href="https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/">VICE
        emulator</a>. I’m looking forward doing the research and writing
        on this one!</p>
        <p>The garden is starting to become a proper garden. At least
        we’re working on it and things are growing. And I’m able to meet
        plenty of critters. Garden, garden work and critters give me a
        lot of joy.</p>
