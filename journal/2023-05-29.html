        <p>Temperatures raised above 25° C, and it feels like summer.
        Had a few free days this Pentecost and enjoyed it after a rather
        dense May. I got some ugly rash on my legs, and I suspect atopic
        eczema because of the stress interfering with my cortisol
        levels. I also visited a psychotherapist and a psychiatrist
        specialised on neuro-feedback to see if we can work on my
        ADHD.</p>
        <p>More than half of the deliverables of this university
        semester are handed it, and I’m not too worried about the rest.
        I still have to do a multi-modal more-than-human piece on the
        beaver family living nearby. Last week I had an intermittent
        presentation on it and received good feedback. Until the end of
        June I’ll work on the piece as well as a text accompanying the
        film.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a
        href="o/v/multimodal_ethnographies_as_practices_of_visiting.html">Multimodal
        ethnographies as practices of visiting</a> (it was spoken, so I
        didn’t correct anything)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also started working on treating a code repository as a
        source for research, and applied some distant reading. The
        process was arduous, but first insights are unfolding.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a

        </ul>
        <p>My research colleague Yannick Rochat shared the essay <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230606020440/https://structuredprocrastination.com/">Structured
        Procrastination</a> with me, and I liked it a lot. It’s a
        fitting piece with <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230526081541/https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/deadlines-as-technology/">Deadlines
        as Technology</a>. It seems that the tools of the mind are as
        important as the organisational tools.</p>
        <p>I also republished my MA Design wiki, which I had archived.
        But with Codeberg static pages, it was so easy to publish
        it.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://ma-design.thgie.ch/">Talking (to)
        Things</a>: A comparative exploration of voice assistants as
        assistive technologies for blind people</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Among other reads, I finished <a
        href="https://wyrms.de/book/2/s/the-dispossessed">The
        Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin</a>. I enjoyed reading it, but
        can’t make much of it otherwise. It seems like a reflection on
        the anarchist freedom.</p>
