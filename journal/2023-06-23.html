        and the multi-species discourse</h1>
        <p>I’m also blogging over at
        https://phd.thgie.ch/notes/Journal.html, but that one is
        specific to my PhD. Besides a stay in Rome for a Digital
        Humanities conference (on which I wrote on the other blog), June
        was much calmer so far. That might also have a connection with
        my new ADHD medication. After my return, I had a session with my
        psy, and we figured that it can make sense to try something to
        balance the specifics of my brain-activity. It seems that parts
        of my brain activate rather quick and over-excited, but then
        become bored and start to chill out. That is also the reason why
        I have a hard time staying on track for any activity. Any other
        external stimuli can take over priority easily.</p>
        <p>The medication I’m getting is a kind of amphetamine,
        Lisdexamfetamin sold under the name Elvanse. I’m having the
        lowest possible dosage, 20mg, on a daily basis. Honestly, it
        felt a bit like LSD microdosing in the beginning, but I quickly
        got accustomed. It helps me a lot. I’m able to hyperfocus during
        the mornings and can stay concentrated on what I want to do
        until the late afternoon. Then I usually get a bit tired and
        more blurry in my focus. I already made so many positive
        experiences now during the last two weeks on medication… being
        able to focus and get things done without struggling and
        hustling gives me a lot of peace of mind and
        self-confidence.</p>
        <p>Things like a talk next week as well as a paper I have to
        hand in don’t stress the fuck out of me, but get me healthily
        excited. I see how the talk will go, since I assume I’ll get
        nervous beforehand. But being able to prepare in peace and when
        I want to already helps very much. I also often experience
        getting into a flow and forgetting time now and usually go a bit
        earlier to bed as before.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, I handed in my last deliverable for the
        more-than-human multi-modal anthropology course.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A reflection on the production of the film: <a
        href="o/v/Interspecies%20infrastructure%20in%20the%20becoming.html">Interspecies
        infrastructure in the becoming</a></li>
        <li>The film itself: <a
        href="https://kdrive.infomaniak.com/app/share/395384/1221e1e7-20ba-4460-b4e1-554f6f6096b7">Visiting</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It was a pleasure to write the reflection (also thanks to the
        meds). Currently, I work a lot with <a
        href="notes/Essay%20Outlines.html">sentence outlines</a>. They are
        a fantastic tool in drafting texts and work very well for me.
        The documentation for the course can be found under <a
        href="notes/Exploring%20Human%20and%20More-than-Human%20Relationships.html">Exploring
        Human and More-than-Human Relationships</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="things">Things</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>I tried to read software source code as literary text: <a
        href="https://phd.thgie.ch/journal/2023-06-20.html">Close
        Reading the VICE Source Code</a>. It was an exciting
        experiment!</li>
        <li>I bought this fantastic album: <a
        href="https://emmaruthrundle.bandcamp.com/album/electric-guitar-one">Electric
        Guitar One by Emma Ruth Rundle</a></li>
        <li>Finished The Mandalorian season 3. The ending was epic, and
        I’m pleased with the outcome. The last shot with Mando resting
        on the porch and Grogu playing with the frog in the pond is
        proper western film aesthetics. It might also have been a
        reference to <a
        href="https://poemanalysis.com/matsuo-basho/the-old-pond/">Matsuo
        Basho’s famous haiku on the old pond and the frog</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Old pond…<br>a frog jumps in<br>water’s sound</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
        <li>I immediately got myself the Obi Wan Kenobi series and the
        Star Wars: Visions animations. Let’s see if they bridge the gap
        until the next Mandalorian season… in like 2025 :(</li>
        <li>Next week starts <a href="https://nifff.ch/">NIFFF 2023</a>.
        My partner and I already watched all the trailers and rated the
        films by priority. Now we have to fix our individual viewing
        programs.</li>
