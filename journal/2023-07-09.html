        transitional spaces</h1>
        <p>Another July, another <a href="https://nifff.ch">NIFFF</a><a
        href="/journal/2023-07-09.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>! I got introduced to this
        film festival by my partner, a true cinephile. We have been
        going to this festival since we came together, which makes this
        the fifth installation I have attended. The program this year
        was extraordinarily tempting, and I decided to buy a festival
        pass that allowed me to watch as many movies as I wanted (or
        could). Making our own program, on which films we want to see,
        has also become kind of a ritual every year. We’ll sit together,
        fill in films and ratings and playtimes into a spreadsheet, and
        then arrange that into something doable. Our final plan included
        15 films each, some of which we didn’t watch together (how could
        somebody not want to see Shin Kamen Raider…).</p>
        <p>The 15 movies and some quick thoughts and ratings on each
        one.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Vincent doit mourir (2023): 4/5 cheeky and violent (the
        French kind) romance</li>
        <li>Consecration (2023): 2/3 nope, boring nunsploitation</li>
        <li>The Cuckoo’s Curse (2023): 3.5/5 flat, but felt
        entertained</li>
        <li>The Abandoned (2022): 4/5 top crime, slightly cheesy</li>
        <li>Superposition (2023): 4/5 supernatural dark noir,
        surprisingly funny</li>
        <li>Shin Kamen Raider (2023): 5/5 over the top, bizarrely
        Japanese</li>
        <li>Silence of the Lambs (1991): 4.5/5 some parts didn’t age
        well</li>
        <li>Tiger Stripes (2023): 5/5 fantastic and feminist Malaysian
        coming of age genre film, loved it thoroughly</li>
        <li>Pearl (2022): 3/5 not bad, but not good either</li>
        <li>Raging Grace (2023): 5/5 Filipino migrant worker
        supernatural folklore, touching and one of my favourites</li>
        <li>Perpetrator (2023): 4/5 Lynch and Cronenberg had a baby, and
        it’s coming of age</li>
        <li>Evil Dead Rise (2023): 4/5 6’500 litres of fake blood, and
        it shows, solid gore and fun</li>
        <li>Augure (2023): 4.5/5 magic realism, Congolese family
        affairs, Italian western inspired</li>
        <li>Tropique (2022): 3.5/5 sci-fi-ish, also family affairs,
        should be critically read towards class…</li>
        <li>Wrath of Becky (2023): 3/5 Becky kills Nazis, but not
        enough, fun kind of gore</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My favourite films this year were <a
        href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14379088/">Shin Kamen
        Raider</a>, <a
        href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10803634/">Tiger Stripes</a>,
        <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14946978/">Raging
        Grace</a> and <a
        href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21086802/">Augure</a>. The
        first film, Kamen Raider, speaks to my nerd heart. It’s just
        brutally bizarre, quick cut and hard to make out any meaning,
        like watching some weird anime… on mushrooms. Who wouldn’t like
        that?</p>
        <p>The other three films had strong leanings towards topics of
        feminism, racism and colonialism from POC-perspectives. All
        three can be read as comments on the shit-show we’re in thanks
        to the patriarchy. It helped tremendously to have Q&amp;A’s with
        the directors after the screenings and have further insights
        into their intentions. I am very glad that <a
        href="https://nifff.ch/en/2023-awards/">Tiger Stripes and Raging
        Grace got awards at NIFFF</a> this year.</p>
        <p>Tiger Stripes, a coming of age story, was an apt description
        of the embodied violence of being a female teenager and how
        taboos and the patriarchy further the suffering of this
        transitional and liminal time. The film music was done by <a
        href="https://svbkvlt.bandcamp.com/album/hoxxxya">Gabber Modus
        Operandi</a> and that’s spectacular. The Indonesia duo is doing
        fantastic hardcore, with metal/noise/punk influences carrying
        Indonesian soundscapes and influences to the listener.</p>
        <p>Raging Grace was a gentle pointer towards the racist
        experience that migrant workers have. The director drew from his
        own and his Filipino parents’ life in the UK. He wanted to work
        through the rage he accumulated during his life, but have the
        film on a more positive note. The racism is gruesome to witness,
        but the film is empowering, ultimately. The rhythm, soundscape
        and music of the film is impressive, and the director said that
        he listened to a metronome on 98bpm while writing.</p>
        <p>Augure had me instantly with its magic realism, and I was
        pretty hyped to see this film. I didn’t expect it to bring me to
        tears… It’s basically about family affairs, complicated by the
        patriarchy, seen as a spectator floating through fantastic lands
        and images. The film was very lively. I loved its aesthetics.
        Most of the outfits were DIY by the director because of the low
        budget.</p>
        <p>This year’s festival was fantastic. We had a lot of sun,
        swam, met many friends and ate good food – next to seeing so
        many good films. It was also too much, and I’m pretty well done
        after these 10 days and 15 films. Then again, aren’t festivals
        meant to do to much? A festival not only as a place of
        celebration but also as a space of ritualistic transition, from
        one state into another. Might that be during the festival or
        from a moment before to one after it.</p>
