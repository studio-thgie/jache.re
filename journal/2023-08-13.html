        <h1 id="a-post-at-the-end-of-summer-holiday">A post at the end
        of summer holiday</h1>
        <p>So, it seems like I had vacation. The first one this year,
        and probably the last one. I messed up my planning, changed jobs
        and started to study. And, especially, the studies and the start
        of the new job (as researcher) kept me apt busy. Then, in
        mid-September the new semester starts, with it four courses to
        attend, and no autumn break. That will occupy me until
        Christmas.</p>
        <p>But, vacation was great. My people reminded me to not even
        think about my dissertation or the research project. I obliged,
        and these two weeks were fantastic. Many photos were made, a lot
        of swimming was going on, we bought an inflatable Kanu and
        discovered another side of the lake I’m living at, plenty of
        friends were met and drinks lifted and all after all, I found a
        good amount of peace and tranquillity. I’m happy I stayed in the
        region, it helped with not having anything to do and stress
        about anything.</p>
        <p>All this leisure time gave me the chance to indulge in
        activities that need time and diligence. I created many personal
        archives, I made a few stickers, and cared a lot about the
        plants at home. We also cleaned thoroughly, which is just so
        satisfying.</p>
        <h2 id="archives-archives-archives">Archives, archives,
        archives</h2>
        <p>Creating the personal archives involved sitting for hours and
        research. I catalogued all the plants we have in our flat. Often
        I didn’t know exactly what species the plant was. So I googled
        descriptions, compared photos, made notes, and collected
        everything first in the Planta mobile app, then transferred
        everything to a sheet. There are now 91 plants at least with
        their Latin name and a link to a page where one finds more info
        on how to care for them.</p>
        <p>My partner introduced me to Letterboxd, a social platform for
        sharing one’s taste for film. You can bookmark films and series
        you saw and could also write reviews and make lists. I tried to
        mark all Sci-Fi and anime films I saw in my life as watched – an
        ongoing work. I tried to do the same with video games, on the
        platform Backloggd, which was created in the spirit of
        Letterboxd. Last but not least I went back to Librarything to
        catalogue all the books that I have currently. I will try to add
        books I once read also to it.</p>

        </ul>
        <h2 id="stickers">Stickers</h2>
        <p>Another thing I did this holiday is stickers! I wanted to
        make some for a while but never came around to investing enough
        concentration. I started with wanting to buy Sci-Hub stickers.
        But they were all of bad quality and not “official”. So I
        investigated the background of the raven illustration and came
        about some interesting things. More on that in this note on the
        <a href="notes/Sci-Hub%20Logo.html">Sci-Hub Logo</a>. There has
        been a bit of collaboration after the initial release and I made
        a repository for the sticker that can be found here <a
        href="https://codeberg.org/thgie/sci-hub-sticker"
        class="uri">https://codeberg.org/thgie/sci-hub-sticker</a>.</p>
        <p>Another sticker I made was about antifascist archives. I
        didn’t find anything in that direction and had fun making one.
        There stickers can be found in their own repository under <a
        href="https://codeberg.org/thgie/antifascist-archives-action-sticker"
        class="uri">https://codeberg.org/thgie/antifascist-archives-action-sticker</a>.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/antifascist-archives-action-sticker.png" width="220" alt="Antifascist Archives Sticker"/></p>
        <p>Last but not least, I made an INSORGIAMO sticker! I read an
        article on the Insorgiamo movement in Italy. The fine people of
        a GKN factory in Firenze took over their workplace when
        everybody got fired. Since then, they came up with a plan on how
        to work together, equally and in accordance with the
        climate-crisis.</p>
        <p>After searching for some graphic material, I haven’t found a
        sticker with their famous banner. So here is one.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/insorgiamo-sticker.png" width="440" alt="INSORGIAMO sticker"/></p>
        <p>This sticker can also be found in a repository under <a
        href="https://codeberg.org/thgie/insorgiamo-sticker"
        class="uri">https://codeberg.org/thgie/insorgiamo-sticker</a>.
        Of course, I also printed all of these stickers in a good
        quality. The Insorgiamo sticker I also made in a cheaper
        version, which I intend to sell and donate the profits to the
        movement.</p>
        <h2 id="no-stress">No-Stress</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of this year, I started to tackle my stress
        problems actively, after I got massive eczema on my legs in an
        especially stressful situation. I ended up having a therapist
        and a coach now, taking ADHD meds and doing neuro-feedback
        session. The progression is slow, even if the meds worked right
        away. But there is progression and I felt more balanced, calmer,
        take many things easier and less existential. That gives me at
        once the possibility to appreciate my life and all the
        experiences I’m making, but also the things I do for work and
        research. There is a just a tad more focus and presence.
        Especially the presence thing was something that I’ve been
        loosing in the last few years. There was a moment where I became
        acutely aware of feeling hazy and cloudy and parted from my
        environment, and I didn’t like it very much. It worried me. Now
        after all the things I learned and did these years to work on
        that (sometimes more, sometimes less) I guess it is really just
        being stressed out and slowly diminishing as a being, becoming a
        static variable in a capitalist system.</p>
        <h2 id="dub-and-rest">Dub and rest</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>While organizing my digital archives, I found an old note on
        <a href="notes/Practice%20Entanglement.html">Practice
        Entanglement</a>, which was not in this digital fallow and has
        now been added.</li>
        <li>Slow driving this Sunday with <a
        href="https://samshackleton.bandcamp.com/track/shackleton-blood-on-my-hands-ricardo-villalobos-remix">Shackleton
        - Blood On My Hands (Ricardo Villalobos remix)</a></li>
        <li>Shackleton made me appreciate dub a lot during the heat that
        was going on the last weeks. The <a
        href="https://jahtari.bandcamp.com/album/elders">Elders album by
        Clouds</a> is a fantastic thing to listen to while chill and
        sweat.</li>
        <li>Also, the <a
        href="https://jahtari.bandcamp.com/album/omega-station">Omega
        Station album by disrupt</a>, if you are into sci-fi soundscapes
        AND dub…</li>
        <li>Not dub, but this song just hits hard and reverbs the shit
        out of breakbeat: <a
        href="https://dreamcatalogue.bandcamp.com/track/tears-in-the-rain">Tears
        in The Rain by Zomby</a> with quotes from the first Bladerunner
        film</li>
        <li>And finally the song <a
        href="https://jahtari.bandcamp.com/track/nah-ina-it">Nah Ina It
        by Paul St. Hilaire</a> which just makes me want to smoke
        hashish until my eyes are as red as on the cover</li>
        </ul>
