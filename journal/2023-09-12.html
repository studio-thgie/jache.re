        <h1 id="fermenting-fish-fermenting-nuts">Fermenting fish,
        fermenting nuts</h1>
        <p>I‚Äôm back in the fermentation business and finally tried some
        new things. After a long hiatus on fermenting animal protein, I
        got my hands on some <a href="notes/Garum.html">Garum</a>. The
        other thing could not be more different from garum in terms of
        process and material, a <a
        href="notes/Fermented%20cashew-spread.html">Fermented
        cashew-spread</a>.</p>
        <p><a
        href="https://umerecords.bandcamp.com/album/malahat">Malahat |
        PJS | Ê¢Ö„É¨„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ</a> goes very well with fermentation if you are
        into ambient and slow stuff and <a
        href="https://iliantape.bandcamp.com/album/it055-recreation">IT055
        - Recreation | Fireground | ILIAN TAPE</a> if you like it a tad
        quicker. The latter makes you jump in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>I moved from Pl@ntNet to iNaturalist because I can also add
        things like insects and mushrooms and what not. So if that is
        down your alley, connect with me via <a
        href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/ttthgie">ttthgie</a>.
        All the observations I made in Pl@ntNet had to be manually
        moved. But it‚Äôs a joy to have my insects online now as well, and
        I already started a biodiversity-project on the squatted
        football-stadium where we have a community-garden plot: <a
        href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/terrain-gurzelen">Terrain
        Gurzelen</a>.</p>
        <p>And for a change, I could get some coding done. Didn‚Äôt do
        much of that for a while. I finally added some features and
        refinements to <a
        href="https://codeberg.org/thgie/pancake.sh">pancake.sh</a>, my
        smol static site generator. I‚Äôm super proud of how it turned out
        üòÖ One of the new features is an automatic RSS feed generator,
        that works with a little YAML parser function for bash, which
        prompted the comment ‚Äú‚Äú<em>Oof, that ‚Äùyaml‚Äù parser using sed is
        cursed :)</em>‚Äù. The parser is definitely cursed, but it works
        really well :D</p>
        <p>Some other things are going on, have been going on, but
        that‚Äôs all for now.</p>
