# Fermenting fish, fermenting nuts
I'm back in the fermentation business and finally tried some new things. After a long hiatus on fermenting animal protein, I got my hands on some [Garum](notes/Garum.md). The other thing could not be more different from garum in terms of process and material, a [Fermented cashew-spread](notes/Fermented%20cashew-spread.md).

[Malahat | PJS | æ¢…ãƒ¬ã‚³ãƒ¼ãƒ‰](https://umerecords.bandcamp.com/album/malahat) goes very well with fermentation if you are into ambient and slow stuff and [IT055 - Recreation | Fireground | ILIAN TAPE](https://iliantape.bandcamp.com/album/it055-recreation) if you like it a tad quicker. The latter makes you jump in the kitchen.

I moved from Pl@ntNet to iNaturalist because I can also add things like insects and mushrooms and what not. So if that is down your alley, connect with me via [ttthgie](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/ttthgie). All the observations I made in Pl@ntNet had to be manually moved. But it's a joy to have my insects online now as well, and I already started a biodiversity-project on the squatted football-stadium where we have a community-garden plot: [Terrain Gurzelen](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/terrain-gurzelen). 

And for a change, I could get some coding done. Didn't do much of that for a while. I finally added some features and refinements to [pancake.sh](https://codeberg.org/thgie/pancake.sh), my smol static site generator. I'm super proud of how it turned out ðŸ˜… One of the new features is an automatic RSS feed generator that works with a little YAML parser function for bash, which prompted the comment ""*Oof, that "yaml" parser using sed is cursed :)*". The parser is definitely cursed, but it works really well :D But, this means there is now a proper [feed.xml](https://jache.re/feed.xml) generated for this blog if you want to follow that.

Some other things are going on, have been going on, but that's all for now.
