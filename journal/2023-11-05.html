        <h1
        id="journaling-tasks-and-sourdough-rye-crispbread">Journaling,
        Tasks, and Sourdough Rye Crispbread</h1>
        <p>I’m doing text file based journaling since 2016 and since
        2020 almost daily. Somewhere along the way, I got the idea, that
        managing my tasks this way would be a good idea …</p>
        <p>Obsidian makes journaling a breeze, but I never really got
        warm with the different ways of managing tasks and calendars. I
        have been using the <a
        href="https://publish.obsidian.html/tasks/">Obsidian Tasks</a> for
        a good two years, and it’s beautiful. It makes creating and
        working with <em>something</em> like tasks within the given
        context effortless. But, for me at least, it never felt quite
        right. It’s a bit of a hassle to get tasks into the system, and
        there is no easy way to get them out of Obsidian.</p>
        <p>One of the most important factors for me is that my data
        stays close and within as-good-as-it-gets data and privacy laws.
        I’m pretty happy if my data stays in Switzerland. To properly
        use Obsidian for task management, I had to sync it to my mobile.
        I didn’t want to pay for Obsidian Sync and iCloud plays right
        into the data problem, even if Apple is doing an ok job. Sync
        via WebDAV with a plugin was subpar and I had to stick to
        iCloud.</p>
        <p>I’m also a big fan of everything CalDAV based (and CardDAV
        for that matter), but there was no sane way to have CalDAV
        working with Obsidian. I love the system’s integration that
        comes with CalDAV based task and event management and how easy
        it is to sync and use different tools for the same sources.</p>
        <p>Long story short. I had to realise that Obsidian is a great
        journaling tool, but a mediocre for task management. But, thanks
        to two other Obsidian plugins, I was able to make my whole setup
        overly complicated and have the best of both worlds … 🥲</p>
        <h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
        <p>Events and tasks go into my CalDAV based calendars that are
        hosted in the western part of Switzerland. I can use whatever I
        have at hand to do so. A modern web interface provided by the
        hoster, Apple Calendar and Reminders, and, I started to use the
        <a href="https://goodtaskapp.com/">GoodTask</a> app for a more
        expanded task management. What I love about GoodTask is, that
        it’s built on top of CalDAV. I don’t need to have its own
        database or data structure. The most important thing, which I
        already used in Obsidian Tasks, are tags. Through the tags I’m
        able to create dynamic lists, for example for #deadlines, or a
        course like #stu/einblicke.</p>
        <h2 id="journaling">Journaling</h2>
        <p>The journaling magic now happens through the Periodic Notes
        and the Templater plugins for Obsidian. I have created a
        template for my daily notes, that automatically pulls the events
        and tasks for a day. The goal is not to work through them, but
        to add them to the journal, have them present during the day,
        and also add them to my growing journal archive. It just works
        on macOS for the moment …</p>
        <h3 id="how-to">How-to</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Install <a
        href="https://hasseg.org/icalBuddy/">icalBuddy</a>, which is a
        command line tool, that enables you to pull from the macOS
        calendar and output it as text</li>
        <li>In the Templater plugin you have to activate
        <code>Trigger Templater on new file creation</code></li>
        <li>I also added two <code>User System Command Functions</code>
        <ul>
        <li><code>events</code>:
        <code>/opt/homebrew/opt/ical-buddy/bin/icalBuddy -nc -po "datetime,title,notes,url" -ps "| |\\n\\t|\\n\\t|" -b "-" -ab "-" -npn -stda -nrd -df " " -tf "%H:%M" eventsFrom:$date to:$date</code></li>
        <li><code>tasks</code>:
        <code>/opt/homebrew/opt/ical-buddy/bin/icalBuddy -nc -po "title,datetime,notes,url" -ps "||\\n\\t|\\n\\t|" -b "- " -ab "- " -npn -stda -nrd -df " ⏳ %Y-%m-%d" -tf "" tasksDueBefore:$date</code></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Customize my daily template below to your needs. Important
        are the two <code>tp.user</code> calls, which Templater
        recognizes and inserts the events and tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code># {{date:dddd}} - [[{{date:YYYY[/]YYYY-MM}}|{{date:MMM}}]] [[{{date:YYYY/gggg-[W]ww}}|{{date:DD}}]], [[{{date:YYYY}}]]

        <p>Another Sunday , another bread. I’m a sucker for all things
        malty, and I made my favorite Knäckebröd, for which I added some
        info under <a href="notes/Baking.html#Rye%20Cripsbread">Rye
        Cripsbread</a>. It’s not the most beautiful thing to look at
        (I’m working on that), but it’s really, really tasty.</p>
