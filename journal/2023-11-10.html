        <h1 id="chatgpt-for-expanding-and-compressing-text">ChatGPT for
        expanding and compressing text</h1>
        <p>I was talking to a friend about how boring AI-generated
        content often is, and I compared generative AI to the
        institutionalization of mediocrity. Nonetheless, do I find
        myself working with generative AI occasionally. Not to create
        something out of thin air, but as a concrete tool for expanding
        and compressing written or spoken text.</p>
        <h2 id="expanding">Expanding</h2>
        <p>One of my most favorite and important steps when writing
        anything is a proper <a
        href="notes/Outlines.html#Sentence%20Outline%5B%202%5D%20versus%20topic%20outline.">Sentence
        Outline</a>. Instead of writing a topic outline with just the
        keywords, I have full sentences, that are the equivalent of a
        paragraph and carry the main point. Both outline types already
        work on the all over all structure of the text. The sentence
        outline needs more work, since the points you want to make
        already have to be made concrete, and not just sketched out.</p>
        <p>Depending on various factors, such as time or availability of
        my medication, I’m unable to work very much on expanding the
        sentence outline into a first draft. Instead, I’ll hand this
        task over to ChatGPT with the prompt
        <code>can you expand the following outline into a text, writing one paragraph per item</code>.
        This usually leads to a pre-draft, written in the
        ChatGPT-typical manner. This pre-draft helps me mirror the text
        to myself, and I’ll have two, or three editing rounds where I
        redraft tone, voice, vocabulary and expressions.</p>
        <h2 id="compressing">Compressing</h2>
        <p>I stopped writing texts for presentations, which I would just
        read afterward. It makes me more nervous and prone to make
        mistakes, and it’s less well perceived by the listeners anyway.
        Instead, I also start with an outline, topic or sentence, and
        create the slides afterward. Visualizing the structure and
        talking points of the presentation usually starts a processing
        of practicing in my head.</p>
        <p>After a few attempts and rounds to find the right words, I’ll
        try to speak the presentation out loud. That often happens when
        I’m going for a walk, since the movement helps me be less
        distracted, and I don’t dwell too much on expressions. I’ll
        record that and let it be transcribed directly, which works
        marvelous these days with a smartphone. The produced text needs
        to be checked for mishearing and then I can hand it over to
        ChatGPT, alongside the prompt
        <code>summarize the following text, structuring it as outline</code>.
        The prompt results in a nicely structured outline, with main-
        and sub-points, and helps me to practice my presentation
        afterwards.</p>
