        despair to relieve ‚Äì¬†Dealing with an ADHD meds fallout</h1>
        <p>In early October I had to learn that my ADHD medicament,
        Elvanse<a href="/journal/2023-12-05.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> on a low 20mg dosage,
        couldn‚Äôt be obtained anymore. My drugstore of choice couldn‚Äôt
        order it anymore and had no more in stock either. There seemed
        to be a supply shortage of this medicament in Switzerland, and
        later in other countries too, I learned. As of early December,
        the shortage is continuing and could last until February 2024<a
        href="/journal/2023-12-05.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. The brief response of the
        drugstore was to contact my psychiatrist, which I did, and who
        unfortunately ghosted me. I would guess a combination of bad
        time management and high workload ‚Äì¬†it‚Äôs late autumn/early
        winter and everybody is about to hit depression. Topping not
        being able to draft an alternative plan, October and November
        were the two months with the highest workload for me. Murphy‚Äôs
        law at its best.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I could have really used my meds during that time.</p>

        <p>ADHD burnout<a href="/journal/2023-12-05.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> hit the hardest towards the
        end of November and on the last weekend of that month I
        collapsed like a souffl√© and felt like a bag of old potatoes. My
        partner got worried and asked if I‚Äôm starting to have ‚Äúweird
        thoughts‚Äù. Luckily, akin to an early X-mas miracle, I was able
        to locate a drugstore who had a small stock left and able to
        mobilize my psy into writing another prescription. Moving the
        prescription wasn‚Äôt possible, since the medicament<a href="/journal/2023-12-05.html#fn4"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> falls under the narcotics
        act in Switzerland and is highly regulated. I am now the proud
        owner of two month worth of Elvanse, and it feels<a href="/journal/2023-12-05.html#fn5"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> really, really good!</p>
        <p>But, after all, I don‚Äôt believe that it was the workload
        alone that did it. What was much harder to take, was the
        frustration of being back to my pre-meds-self. Having received
        my diagnosis with 42 means, that I lived half a life and managed
        to deal with the circumstances. And I did good. Nothing
        exceptionally, but I was able to live my life according to my
        wishes. When I started to take Elvanse early summer this year, I
        got to know a complete different aspect of myself. I was able to
        just sit down and execute whatever I put my mind to. Like
        writing this blog post ‚Ä¶</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Somebody on Instagram described a variant of ADHD like having
        three squirrels on speed in their head.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I forgot that this part of myself exists, especially during a
        wonderful summer where I was able to deep-dive research and get
        stuff done, and ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like that part of myself very much.
        This being on and off the meds made this difference in being
        myself very apparent to myself. One of the toughest parts was
        the physical inability to do some things that didn‚Äôt inherent
        motivate me. I wanted to write this blog post a longer time ago,
        without the positive outlook back then. But I couldn‚Äôt. I
        couldn‚Äôt even sit down and just think about it, it gave me
        tensions and ants crawling my body and drove me off to do
        something else. The patience and energy of an avalanche of
        pebbles going down a mountain slope.</p>
        <p>Being back on meds means, I can sit down, look up my tasks
        that say ‚ÄúWrite blog post on meds fallout‚Äù and I do that in one
        sitting, without thinking, without outline or brainstorming. I‚Äôm
        happy to be back on meds. But, I guess I have some work to do to
        integrate that part of myself that I don‚Äôt like too much. You
        have to be able to love yourself, no matter what üíñ</p>
