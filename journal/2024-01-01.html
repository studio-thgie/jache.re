        <h1 id="some-notes-on-organization-and-journaling">Some notes on
        organization and journaling</h1>
        <p>During my winter vacation, I listened to the two last
        episodes of the <a
        href="https://powerful-possibilities.captivate.fm/">Powerful
        Possibilities: ADHD from New Diagnosis &amp; Beyond</a> podcast.
        They were about how people with ADHD deal with time, and it was
        insightful. Something, something about the volume of gray
        matter, dopamine, the now and the not now and the time horizon.
        I guess I’d need to read into some of the sources to fully trust
        Katherine on the science that backs the episodes. The coaching
        part, on the other hand, was fantastic and made me rethink a
        substantial part of my day-to-day organization.</p>
        <p>I recently changed back to CalDAV since doing project- and
        task management in Obsidian is just too messy for me. Might work
        for some, but for me, a lot of the things fall into nooks and
        crannies, and it’s difficult to get a proper overview. I tried
        to put too much into Obsidian: Daily overview of my events and
        tasks, some daily reflection, a log of what I’ve done, notes and
        new tasks and some journaling. Having events and tasks in CalDAV
        is sustainable and enables me to approach it through different
        apps while still making sure that the data is safe in
        Switzerland. Listening to the podcast episodes made me aware
        that I’m stressing myself a lot. So I removed everything but the
        journaling part and a random question per day. Obsidian
        journaling only now.</p>
        <p>Some notes I made from the episodes. When thinking about
        things to organize yourself, you should ask yourself some
        questions.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Where are my challenges showing up, and how do they affect
        me? What do I want to change about that? Am I ready to let go of
        the stress and pain?</li>
        <li>What are my preferred information processing
        modalities?</li>
        <li>Who do I want to be in the future? How do I want to live?
        What will it feel like?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>She continues to propose some things:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Get an analog clock, make time material/physical and not
        just intellectual</li>
        <li>Shorten the time horizon</li>
        <li>Create consequences, like adding positive outcomes and
        rewards to commitments</li>
        <li>Visualize time when planning</li>
        <li>Connect with your future self and thank past me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The solution to dealing with time is not time blocking.
        Emotional regulation is one significant aspect when dealing with
        ADHD. People with ADHD are much more likely to avoid problems. I
        need to figure out how a task is affecting me emotionally. Make
        the things that could fail ridiculously small. We run on
        interests, not priorities. How can I make boring or tough but
        important tasks interesting? Once more, exercise is an essential
        aspect that helps regulate dopamine levels. It doesn’t have to
        be big, just go for a walk at least.</p>
        <p>Takeaways:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Check emotional regulation often</li>
        <li>Interests &gt; priorities</li>
        <li>make time phenomenological instead of just intellectualize
        it (kinetic and visual)</li>
        <li>Journaling as a habit with a more or less fixed rhythm</li>
        <li>Keep task tracking as easy and stress-free as possible</li>
        <li>Exercise, exercise, exercise</li>
        <li>Connect to future me and thank past me &lt;3</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In practice:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Events and tasks in CalDAV</li>
        <li>Daily journaling towards emotional reflection; Write a blog
        post once a month</li>
        <li>Weekly PhD journaling about what I did and reflection</li>
        <li>Post-Its and Obsidian Canvas for time visualization</li>
        <li>Get a wristwatch</li>
        <li>Regularly schedule do-nothing time, where I lay on the floor
        and watch the ceiling</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="besides">Besides</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Louie, one of the parrots I had as a pet, died in December.
        That fucked me up, and I haven’t cried like that in a while.
        Super tragic story, and the original sin was to get him as a pet
        in the first place. I feel very guilty about that.</li>
        <li>Watched the utterly beautiful film <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont_(film)">Fremont</a>
        in the cinema.</li>
        <li>Reading the pretty bad <a
        href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1613280.Last_Rituals">Last
        Rituals</a>. It might be a problem with the German translation.
        Then again, it’s good to read something easy going.</li>
        <li>Removed a lot of clutter and trinkets from my personal
        space. It’s nice to have a cleared room.</li>
        </ul>
