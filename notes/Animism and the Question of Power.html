        Power</h2>
        <p>In design we are entangled with many power dynamics and
        hierarchies. Every project within design, and design research,
        needs to ask itself, how it decides to tackle these issues of
        gender, race and class; intersectionality.</p>

        <li>Animism as a post-phenomenological interface to
        technology</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are [^1] attempts to decenter the human perspective.
        Not as in devaluing the human but to show, that we are embedded
        within complex webs of relations and ecologies with equally
        important partners; from bacterias and mushrooms to sidewalks,
        the materials we use to build stuff and also electronic devices.
        The problem is, that we miss a frame of reference for such a
        viewpoint. Akin to intersectional topics, negative stereotypes
        are reinforced through the way we design things. When design
        things for boys ang girls, a binary view on gender is
        reproduced. Animsm in design can help to function as an
        aesthetic interface to the acceptance of a more complex view on
        the world and repositioning the human; from the center of all
        that is, to being in a web of relations of equally important
        actant. It can also function as an epistemological interface to
        things that donâ€™t materialise, like hyperobjects and imaginary
        concepts.</p>
