        epistemological interface</h1>
        <h2 id="contextualising">Contextualising</h2>
        <p>For the longest time, I struggled with having access to
        <em>an</em> animism, since I do neither have a cultural
        background nor do I come from a community where animism is
        practiced. Working with animism on a purely theoretical level is
        stimulating, but essentially not worth much. I found that
        reframing animism as a epistemological interface to deal with
        reality’s complexities is the most fertile approach in my
        personal case, and maybe for people with a similar profile.</p>
        <p>Animisms stemming from indigeneous epistemologies often have
        rich mythological and aesthetic narratives to give form to the
        specific animism. The way animisms are organized and
        institutionalised also differ quite a lot, even from community
        to community. Animism, as I understand it by now, is to give
        mental and emotional form to the non-human. Not necessarily by
        humanizing it, but by shaping it into a narrative, that humans
        can relate to or understand. For example, when flora talks, they
        often have their own language and this language can’t be
        expressed in human language. But they have language nonetheless
        and that is a human concept.</p>
        <h2 id="rooting-animism">Rooting animism</h2>
        <p>Now, they way to deal with animism without having a animistic
        culture or community as backing is to let it emerge through
        practice, mind, and empathy – as well as acceptance and
        entanglement. Animism doesn’t necessarily need a mythological
        and aesthetic form, although that helps a lot. Animism in it’s
        essence is the acceptance that there are realities-beyond-human
        that are of equal value as the one of human’s, and that we need
        to act accordingly. Fauna, flora, mushrooms, and minerals
        constitute worlds of being in their own right.</p>
        <p>I don’t think that there needs to be a philosophical and
        ethical base for this. Euro-centric epistemologies tend to
        complicate things by overthinking and by dragging a long tail of
        missleading thought with – see the discourse on conciousness for
        example. Animism, as well as the felt and experienced worth of
        the human and non-human comes from an experienced and lived
        reality. This means that being rooted, entangled and in relation
        are of utmost importance. The value of the pluriverse [<span

        data-cites="escobarDesignsPluriverseRadical2018">[reading/@escobarDesignsPluriverseRadical2018|(Escobar,
        2018)]</span>] is evident if you depend on it in your direct
        experience.</p>
        <h2 id="resisting-capitalism">Resisting capitalism</h2>
        <p>A good way to arrive there is to actively create connection,
        for example through practices like [<span class="citation"
        data-cites="dumitWritingImplosionTeaching2014">[reading/@dumitWritingImplosionTeaching2014|writing
        the implosion]</span>]. This needs a two-fold effort on our
        behalf. We have to at once resist the active deconnective ways
        of neoliberalism and it’s subsidiaries of marketing and other
        fomo and fearmongering services. The way todays capitalist
        society works, is by repackaging what has relation into a
        relationless but hyped narrative that you as a customer can buy
        into. This is one aspect of neoliberal alienation. The second
        effort we have to make is to accept the messy and often
        uncomfortable truth about reality. I have the feeling, that I’m
        often surrounded by a lot of convenience. Making life easier is
        one of the best things we can do during our little time we have
        on this planet. But we need to make life easier for everybody
        and everything, not just a few individuals as is the case in a
        capitalist society, while everything and everybody else is just
        externalities. A good way to go about that is honesty towards
        messiness as in [<span class="citation"

        Shotwell's Against Purity]</span>]. Anti-capitalist rant
        off.</p>
        <p>Or in the words of one of my favourite game makers, Avery
        Alder:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In November, a friend asked me about goblin, and I wrote her
        saying “being goblin is a way of flagging that you want to
        include people not in spite of their sloppiness and uneven
        emotional growth, but because of it – because goblins come as
        they are, and they grow in community with one another. Being
        goblin means being intergenerational in an un-precious way. It
        means that kids are a part of community, that their messes and
        tantrums and experiments and giggles all take place between our
        feet. It’s about acknowledging disability and madness and trauma
        in a way that removes normalcy as our baseline. Every body is a
        weird body and weird is good. Accommodating one another’s
        weirdness isn’t just worthwhile and important, and it’s not
        useful to frame it as noble or anything like that. Accommodating
        one another’s weirdness is the literal basis of goblin
        community. It’s how you nest, it’s how you romp, it’s what
        goblins always and necessarily do.” <a href="/notes/Animism as epistemological interface.html#fn1"

        </blockquote>
        <p>Now we just need to expand that towards the non-human.</p>
        <h2 id="personal-approach">Personal approach</h2>
        <p>My personal approach to do this is three-fold and is quite
        close to aforementioned [<span class="citation"
        data-cites="dumitWritingImplosionTeaching2014">[reading/@dumitWritingImplosionTeaching2014|writing
        the implosion]</span>].</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>First, one starts by tracing the history and
        coming-into-being of the thing in question. Where does it come
        from? What are it’s origins? What parts do constitute the thing
        and where do these come from?</li>
        <li>From there you move to questions of relationalities. Who was
        involved in the thing at what stage of it’s becoming? How are
        those people living, feeling, thinking? How much of their time
        and energy do they effort into the thing?</li>
        <li>Now you can start to realize the sheer size of complexity,
        entanglement and involvement of even the simplest things.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Out of this realisation emerges (but as in actively created
        by us) a kind of thing-egregore<a href="/notes/Animism as epistemological interface.html#fn2"

        href="/notes/Animism as epistemological interface.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. Although I do not have a
        mythological or aesthetical form to give to this thing-spirit,
        it still has a presence, not unlike a voice assistant device
        (like the Amazon Echo) has a presence in your home. It’s not
        materialised, but it has a place and form in your mind. This
        realisations furthers the understanding that a given thing
        contains complexities far beyond myself, while still holding a
        multitude of relationships linking myself to the larger
        reality.</p>
