        <p>Animism is essentially the awarding of sameness, as in same
        or similar ontological status, to the other-than-human. That is
        to treat the other-than-human equally, despite not being human.
        It receives the same ethical considerations as I, and it is
        thought of as having the same ontological richness as I. Animism
        then is expressed through different aesthetical interfaces;
        spirits, ghosts and souls, conciousness, agency, and so forth.
        This is the domain of the designer or storyteller, to convey and
        realise these interfaces. If there is no epistemological
        framework present to tap into this mycelium of stories, rich in
        material, the designer then can revert to trigger
        phenomenological responses; illusions of character through
        erratic movement, uncertainty and ambiguity, physical presences
        reminescent of living things, growth patterns and evolutionary
        processes, multi-modal feedbacks and the usage of language,
        understandable or not.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Animism as an interface to complexity, without reducing the
        messyness (as in traditional ux design) by accepting tech as
        uncertain and ambiguous systems.</li>
        <li>What is the social relevance of an animist/non-human
        approach to design of technological artefacts?
        <ul>
        <li>Animism as an aesthetic interface, arising from a
        (post-)phenomenological approach to the design of technological
        artefacts enabling a different approach to tech-sphere (care,
        bonding, ethics, messyness).</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Why an animist approach to the design of tech things is
        important</li>
        <li>could machine help us with privacy, instead of the opposite?
        can machine protect us from fascist regimes, manipulation</li>
