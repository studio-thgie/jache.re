## Notes
- Hydration: the ration of flour to water. 1 part water and 1 part flour would be 100% hydration.
- Breadspice: mix of caraway seeds, anis seeds, fennel seeds, and coriander seeds ground to your liking. I also like to add [bertram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacyclus_pyrethrum).

## Bread
### Sourdough starter 
- mix 1 part flour and 1 part water, any flour will do, for example 50g white flour and 50ml water
- let rest in a dark and warm, not hot, spot
- next day, add same amount of flour and water
- repeat for a few days until you have a sourly smelly, maybe bubbly mass
- trust your nose, if it smells funky but agreable, you've succeded
- if you see something fuzzy (white, green, gray, etc), that's mold, discard and start new

If, in this process, you have to much material, don't discard it. Just make some [easy flatbread](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/quick_flatbreads_43123). You should name your starter, and have a relationship with it. In a best case scenario you'll be together for the rest of your life. I've got mine now for nine years (in 2023) and she is called Annina.

- if you keep your starter outside, feed 1 part flour and 1 part water several times a week
- if you keep your starter in the fridge, whatever… I forgot my starter for month and it was actually moldy on top. I just scraped that off and feed it and it's alive and kicking. sometimes you'll have black fluid collecting on top. That's a kind of alcoholic by product. It's not very tasty I found out…

### 70% Hydration, no fold sourdough
- ratio: 5 parts flour, 3.5 parts water, 1.5 parts sourdough starter (100% hydration)
- for example: 330g flour, 230ml water, 100g sourdough, 5-10g salt

- mix: incorporate everything within 30sec, no kneading
	- 1h resting
- add salt
	- 30min resting
- fold: wet hands, fold four corners into middle
	- 30min resting
- fold. ditto
	- 30min resting
- fold: ditto
	- 30min resting
- shape 1/2: flip onto floured workspace, fold corners in, flip again to let rest on seam
	- 30min resting
- shape 2/2: shape into ball by slightly pull top under, best if you watch a video on this part, tough to explain in words
	- 3h rest in proofing basket
	- it would be possible to do this step here over night in the fridge, for about 12 - 15h of slow proofing. take out and let warm up for 1 - 2h.
- bake
	- preheat casserolle in oven
	- flip onto baking paper in soup dish, make cuts
	- 45min at 240° in casserolle with lid
	- 15min at 200° without lid

## Journal
### Sunday, 15th January 2023
In this recipe I added afformentioned bread spices, rather roughly ground by hand. The flour part is a mix of 1/3 einkorn (some old sort of wheat) and 2/3 [Ruchmehl](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruchmehl), which is a flour where parts of the grains outer shell layers are left in.

During the folding phase.

That's between shaping 1/2 and 2/2.

I used rice flour to seam the proofing basket. I made bad experience with white flour, and rice flour keeps the dough from sticking.

Finished proofing, flipped into soup-dish.
