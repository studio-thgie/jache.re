# Brache

## 1
4th Feb 2023: My dear friend Daniel and I visited a fallow nearby, also discussed the term and it's meaning in different languages. The German Brache is applicable quite extensively, whereas English and French need different words for what Brache can deliver. I am in awe, by how a Brache negates productivity and capitalism, by merely existing. There is philosophical value to be found here.
