        Houseplants</h1>
        <p>There are different types of houseplant-owners. On on end of
        the spectrum we have people, who keep plants for purely
        decorative reasons. Then on the other end there are plants, with
        whom people talk, and where the plants are intimately tied to
        stories.</p>
        <p>On of the two sides is more sustainable. The moment you start
        to care about a plant, you give more attention to its wellbeing
        and needs. A well cared for plant lives longer, and probably
        happier as well.</p>
        <p>Many of my houseplants are embedded in a story; one I rescued
        from my office, one belonged to a friend’s aunt, who is in
        palliative care, others I bought together with friends on a
        market and the images of that day are still vivid, living within
        the plant. With some of my plants I’m really proud at how well
        they are doing and I’m telling them that as well.</p>
        <p>Through this care, I develop an intimate and affective
        relationship with them. Through this affective relationship with
        these plants they are also imbued with agency over me. My caring
        for them makes them affecting me; relationships always go both
        ways.</p>
        <p>This is animism through care.</p>
        <p>The ontological status of the houseplant is hightened, from a
        mere passive object to something inbetween that and a person; a
        non-human person within a more-than-human entanglement.</p>
