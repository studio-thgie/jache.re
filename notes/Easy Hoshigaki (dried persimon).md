# Easy Hoshigaki (dried persimon)
Hoshigaki is pretty straight forward.

- Peel unripe persimon 
- Let new skin dry and harden
- Then massage persimon on a daily base to soften pulp inside
- Wait until crumbled up and sugar is crystalizing outside, making the persimon whiteish

In my easy variant, I don't hang the persimon, I'll just put them on a piece of cardboard and sometimes on a heater. I made the experience, that fruit flies get on the naked persimon, and leave behind scars for mold. Placed on the heater, the fruit flies don't touch the fruits.
