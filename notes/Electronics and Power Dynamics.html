        Dynamics</h1>
        <p>There is a power dynamic in play here. We’re not just
        consumers of technological artifacts. The discourse on big data
        and privacy have shown that the tech companies have reimagined
        us. We’re no longer clients, we’re also products ourselves. As
        with social media and algorithmic mediation, big tech doesn’t
        wont us to simply use their products. They also want to have
        complete control over how we do that, or when and where for that
        matter. I hypothise, that they go as far as to condition us
        through the devices we surround ourselves; smartphones, tablets
        and voice assistants. Looking at it this way, of course we can’t
        have a healthy self-determined relationship with technological
        artifacts.</p>
        <p>Give critique more room. Showing, that alternative ways of
        imagine human-tech relationships are possible, maybe even focus
        on that imagination. Because, there is a pedagogy in how we let
        people interact with designed things. We learn through that. If
        we let people call voice assistants whores and kick them, that
        does something with us.</p>
