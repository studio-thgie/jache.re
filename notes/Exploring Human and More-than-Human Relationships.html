        <p><em>…aka some thoughts made in the beginning of the
        course</em></p>
        <p>The idea behind this project is the coming together of
        different water infrastructures, some human-made, some
        non-human-made. The small river Suze traverses the city of
        Biel/Bienne. At one point, a small dam, two smaller streams are
        forked off. I assume this was made for industrial reasons, as
        well as being able to control the water flow. The whole of
        Seeland was a giant water-mediating project, in order to gain
        land. The smaller stream is generally in a bad shape, highly
        mediated and not the prettiest thing. Further down they
        “renaturalized” it, in parallel to newly built apartments. Now,
        in the “renaturalized” part a beaver built his home, a beaver
        dam. The beaver’s infrastructure dammed up the water, and it was
        endangering the gardenish area of the new apartments. The city
        decided nonetheless to let the beaver where it is and install
        overflow-pipes, that ensure the proper flow of the water-stream.
        I am very interested in how these water-infrastructures come
        together and change their respective environments.</p>
        <h2 id="waiting-hoping-for-a-beaver-to-appear">Waiting, hoping
        for a <a href="notes/On%20Beavers.html">beaver</a> to appear</h2>
        <p><em>…aka thoughts made before working on the final
        piece</em></p>
        <p>At first the place pulled me in through it’s urban
        wilderness, in lack of a better word, unfolding from it being
        forgotten and unused. Seemingly nobody makes a claim to it, and
        the place can rest, not unlike a fallow. This wilderness is a
        pleasant contrast to the otherwise constantly cleaned
        city-space. It eminates a specific kind of tranquility, in which
        other-than-human can go about their ways in their own
        manner.</p>
        <p>When I started to listen in I needed to relearn the place. It
        was an exhausting process. The once calm path became intense and
        teaming with sonical life. So many birds, so many industrial
        outlets, cars, and the unbearable loud and stinging white noise
        of the dam. Some thing became more present, such as the
        clickedyclack of passing bicycles. Or the crow colony from two
        blocks over. The water, once central to my visuality, almost
        completely vanished.</p>
        <p>After many recording session, video- and sound-wise, I have
        yet to see an actual beaver. I might never see one. But, I have
        gotten in touch with the place, and I love that. I love to get
        in touch with place. It’s a mere 8 to 10 minute stretch of a
        walk, from dam to dam. Again and again, I am politely visiting,
        as outlined by Donna Haraway when talking about the practice of
        Vinciane Despret.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Referring both to her own practice for observing scientists
        and also to the practices of ethologist Thelma Rowell observing
        her Soay sheep, Despret affirmed “a particular epistemological
        position to which I am committed, one that I call a virtue: the
        virtue of politeness.” In every sense, Despret’s cultivation of
        politeness is a curious practice. She trains her whole being,
        not just her imagination, in Arendt’s words, “to go
        visiting.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The more often I visit, the more I listen, the more stories
        come into presence, or layers, or threads. Birds, path, plants,
        felled or not, bicycles, sounds, pulled long or formed
        spherical, reflections in the water, all woven together. Not
        into a chaotic whole, but into a walkable pattern. Street, dam,
        path, bridge, long stretch, street, path, dam, path, street,
        deepening on where one is starting.</p>
        <p>I will continue with recording and attempt to layer, or
        weave, the material into a listenable pattern. One that
        recreates my all-over-all, or summarised experience of the place
        through sonic and visual material.</p>

        <li><em>2023-05-25</em> Feedback from the final presentation
        <ul>
        <li>formally it was spot on,</li>
        <li>my own relationship with the situation with the</li>
        <li>traces are very nice</li>
        <li>interspecies dam is spot on</li>
        <li>human dam is very dominant in the beginning</li>
        <li>texts are very heavy, but was ok in this context</li>
        <li>collage, maybe montage: Christian Transcultural Montage
        (transspecies montage)</li>
        <li>what language will i use to frame the beaver? the frames
        were very constructed; how to get out of the anthropocene,
        aesthetically</li>
        <li>how can images/montage be polite; self-reflective</li>
        <li>maybe be not to to self-reflective
        (over-interintelectualizing)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><em>2023-05-07</em> I watched some beaver documentaries to
        learn how beavers are framed in popular media. They’re mostly
        coined by two benefitial factors: economics and environmental.
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Mmjm22GiY">Beavers
        Without Borders</a> is a good example of what I might call
        beaver propaganda, basically saying, just reintroduce the beaver
        as quick and as hard as possible.</li>
        <li><em>2023-04-13</em> Another recording session, this time in
        the evening, when the sun set. I feel like stalking the beaver.
        I concentrated on some video recordings of the traces of the
        beaver. I could also collect two new birds on my birder app. I
        entered the industrial area and filmed some of the felled trees
        and bushes, and also took some of the sticks and tree-shavings
        the beaver left with me.</li>
        <li><em>2023-04-06</em> Feedback
        <ul>
        <li>Keep the woman talking about the heron in the piece</li>
        <li>Think about mapping what the beaver does, it’s
        infrastructures on my own work, or process</li>
        <li>Concentrate on the interaction between humans and
        more-than-humans</li>
        <li>Continue with the interview</li>
        <li>Have a look at the affective agency on the beaver</li>
        <li>How will I deal with the absence of the beaver? Have a look
        at how documentaries work: Assemblages of info-bits, leaving the
        arc/story to the viewer</li>
        <li>Where to get a trap cam?</li>
        <li>Is there any archival material on the beaver in
        Biel/Bienne</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><em>2023-04-02</em> Just-sound recording session today. I
        did the thing where you hear what the mic hears and it was very
        intense. Sound as sense becomes exagerated. It’s very
        interesting to point the mic in all kinds of directions and
        control the listening like this. I haven’t listened to the
        recordings yet, but I’m actually looking forward to what it does
        to me. The enhanced soundscape produces zones of sound, that
        became visual in my mind. Like spheres where some sounds were
        prevalent and others diminuished. It also made me aware of the
        different layers of infrastructures, which interact with each
        other and can be experience differently, depending on the mode
        of transportation.</li>
        <li><em>2023-04-01</em> While reading John Berger’s “Why look at
        animals?”, the beaver got mentioned two times. The second time,
        that it’s one of the last visible animals with intelligence.
        That is sad. There could be an interesting link to topics of
        industrialism.</li>
        <li><em>2023-03-23</em> We could show our recordings. Some
        feedback I got included concentrating more on the sound
        recording and listening process. Two thoughts arising
        afterwards:
        <ul>
        <li>focus on the absence of the beaver but it’s presence through
        difference</li>
        <li>maybe make an interview but put it in the background,
        passing, like some people walking by</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><em>2023-03-17</em> Reading the two texts on <a
        href="reading/novakKeywordsSound2015.html">Listening</a> and the
        <a href="reading/coxSoundAnthropology2018.html">Anthropology of
        Sound</a> made me accutely aware how intense these discourses
        were already debatted in anthropology. The latter text was
        mainly a collection of different aspects of the anthropology of
        sound and mentioned projects in each. The first was an easy
        accessible text on what listening actually is. Cox mentioned a
        project that listened into sounds of the ocean and now I want to
        build a DIY hydrophone. But actually I could just use my iPhone
        to make underwater recordings.</li>
        <li><em>2023-03-08</em> I found the paper <a
        href="reading/westmorelandMultimodalityReshapingAnthropology2022a.html">Multimodality:
        Reshaping Anthropology</a> extremely tough to access. Many key
        parts are deeply rooted in inner discourse that I have little
        knowledge of. I will have to revisit my notes at some times to
        recall the text.</li>
        <li><em>2023-03-06</em> As a multimodal approach is dependent on
        technology – such as recording gear, the cloud, and algorithms –
        such an approach needs to be reflected upon and considered in
        order to not simply reproduce injustice and inequalities
        prevalent in that domain. A multimodal approach is no inherently
        democratic.</li>
        <li><em>2023-03-05</em> Second recording session, same topic.
        Light and wind were in favour. This time I decided not to cut
        anything, just recordings. I’d love to present them and talk
        about the idea.</li>
        <li><em>2023-02-26</em> I followed up my idea of make some
        recordings about the beaver dam. It was very cold and very
        windy. Even with a windshield, the sound was in a bad shape. The
        light also wasn’t the best and the image is pale.</li>
