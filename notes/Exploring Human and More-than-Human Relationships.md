# Exploring Human and More-than-Human Relationships
*Multimodal Approaches*

## Thoughts
- *2022-03-06* As a multimodal approach is dependent on technology – such as recording gear, the cloud, and algorithms – such an approach needs to be reflected upon and considered in order to not simply reproduce injustice and inequalities prevalent in that domain. A multimodal approach is no inherently democratic.
