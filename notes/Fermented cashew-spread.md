# Fermented cashew-spread
I got hold of a book on vegan cheese, through a bring-and-get Telegram channel in my hometown. It's in German, *Veganer Käse* by *Miyoko Schinner*. Until recently, I just had store-bought vegan cheese and they usually come with some ingredients that are only necessary because they can't produce that kind of food otherwise, on a industrial scale. What I liked about the book's recipes is the extensive usage of rejuvelac, a fermented grain-drink that I didn't know! So, they had me at [fermentation](notes/Fermenting%20and%20pickling.md)…

## Recipe
- Rejuvelac
	- Sprout grains, quinoa works great
	- When sprouted, add 3 parts water to 1 part sprouted grains
	- Let rest for three to five days until it looks like fresh made lemonade and smells fruity-funky
- Fermented cashew-spread
	- Mix 1 part rejuvelac with 5 parts overnight-soaked cashews
	- Add a light amount of salt, not for taste, you can always add salt later
	- Blend it to hummus-like consistency
	- Fill into container and let rest for a few days in a warm spot, taste sporadically if it's to your liking

This spread can be used for a lot of fresh-cheese styled creations. Search the net, there is plenty. I already enjoyed it like this, and I could even win over my cheese-loving mother. I made another one, where I added [Miso](notes/Miso.md) and nutritional yeast. Super tasty…
