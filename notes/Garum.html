        <p>After my legendary attempt<a href="/notes/Garum.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> to lacto-ferment
        fish in 2018, I didn’t touch meat-fermentation any more.
        Somewhat later, I got gifted <a
        href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/1163602171">The Noma guide
        to fermentation</a>. It’s an OK book. It’s nice to look at. It’s
        not very efficient for homesteading. And, it’s nothing that the
        internet could not also provide in terms of information or
        knowledge, or pretty pictures.</p>
        <p>But, it was very inspirational in terms of trying out things.
        I got my hands on koji to make my <a
        href="notes/Miso.html">Miso</a>, instead of relying on
        store-bought material, and it was really worth it. I always had
        to figure out the infrastructural stuff out myself because, the
        fuck with having a fermentation chamber that can hold steady 60°
        Celsius for several months…</p>
        <p>One thing stuck with me in particular was the ✨ <em>Rose
        Petal Shrimp Garum</em> ✨ I’m a sucker for fish sauce. The Noma
        book suggests some energy and time-consuming process, and I
        wasn’t down for it. I mean, they didn’t have those kinds of
        tools to work with in the old days, did they? So I searched my
        way around and found some fantastic information about how to
        make garum with at home, and that’s definitely my kind of thing:
        letting oversalted fish devour itself and rot in a
        yoghurt-maker!</p>
        <p>I’m almost finished with my first batch (2023-09-12).</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Get small fish, best fresh, whole, not cleaned, not
        disembowelled</li>
        <li>Cut it up and mix it with 15-20% salt</li>
        <li>Stuff the mix into glassware and let rest in the
        yoghurt-maker for a few days, stirring or shaking
        occasionally</li>
        <li>Store the container somewhere for a few weeks</li>
        <li>At one point you can sift the mess, retain the liquid, get
        rid of the rest</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <li>The yoghurt containers were filled with liquid pretty
        quickly. Between the chunky and the fluid state are just two
        days. After that, not much happened, just slow cooking and the
        meat coming apart.</li>
        <li>I refilled the single container into one larger one because
        they weren’t evenly filled, and I wasn’t confident if they were
        equal in terms of salt and enzymes from the digestive system of
        the fish.</li>
        <li>It started quickly to deliciously smell like salted
        anchovies, but just when opening the container. I also tasted
        the</li>
        <li>Wunderlich, in the <a href="/notes/Garum.html#sources">sources</a> down
        below, has some interesting recipes what to do with this
        base-Garum.</li>
