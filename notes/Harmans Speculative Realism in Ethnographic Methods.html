        Speculative Realism in Ethnographic Methods</h1>
        <p>If we consider objects in the light of speculative realist
        theory we begin to see the possibility for new forms of
        anthropological method and analysis. In the recent past,
        anthropology has shied away from analysing landscapes because of
        fears of flattening our views of the world. However, <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pENVHOAtpk4">Tsing</a>
        states that landscapes can be very ë<a
        href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~ktellez/geertz1973.pdf">thick.í</a>
        Landscapes encompass the material and the imagined, the past and
        the present, they acknowledge the potential for change, and they
        represent political and social realities on an aesthetic and
        phenomenological level. They allow for the real to be real, and
        for all things to be intra-related, as each thing thrives or
        perishes in the life-making project of all other objects.
        Landscapes also allow for conversation and collaborative
        research with other specialists; botanists, geologists,
        physicists, and historians to name just a few, in order to make
        manifest some of the more subtle connections and entanglements
        involved in the enactments of the world. Landscapes enable us to
        reconcile things that flow, such as time, with things that jump,
        such as technology. This could be seen as the central aim of not
        only anthropology, but also of the natural sciences and
        metaphysics. As Harman states, by reconciling things that ëflow
        with things that jumpí we bring the world and objects within it
        onto the <em>mezzanine level</em>, where we can analyse
        phenomena in context. By doing this we have the opportunity to
        make manifest individual human experience (which has its own
        dimensions and functions on an interior level according to its
        own rules) on the <em>mezzanine level</em> of the world,
        anchored in a shared reality of spaces, places, and
        movement.</p>
