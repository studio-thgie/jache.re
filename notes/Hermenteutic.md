# Hermenteutics…
"…is the theory and methodology of interpretation" and "Modern hermeneutics includes both verbal and non-verbal communication as well as semiotics, presuppositions, and pre-understandings. Hermeneutics has been broadly applied in the humanities, especially in law, history and theology."[^1]

So hermeneutics is mainly about reading into things, try to understand them, create meaning or knowledge by way of interpretation.
