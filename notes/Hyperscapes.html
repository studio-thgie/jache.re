        <p>So I visited the Hyperspaces exhibition
        (https://kornhausforum.ch/ausstellung/hyperscapes). tl;dr: I
        enjoyed the works presented but I didn’t like the exhibition
        much… if that makes any sense.</p>
        <p>I missed the curational reflexion. As presented, it seemed to
        me as if somebody had a good idea (Virtual landscape as a place
        of longing), and then placed some works more or less related to
        that into a room. The curational theme/exhibition guidance is
        rather weird and based on <em>states of perception</em> as well
        as a topographic map that was enhanced through DALL-E (…no
        comment). The exhibition opens up with landscape paintings, but
        then doesn’t delve on the difference of landscape portrayal in
        those paintings and new media. Worse even, there is no reflexion
        on the specifics of video games. Within the given setting they
        are treated more or less as video projections. The aspects of
        interaction and participation are left to the visitor to ponder
        upon.</p>
        <p>Sadly the two VR installations didn’t work because of some
        technical issues. Except for Deer Hunter and Terra Nil all works
        focused on 3d. That said, I really enjoyed playing Deer Hunter
        as an artwork on landscape meditation. And playing Ten Lands
        (https://melaniecourtinat.com/Ten-Lands) on such a big display
        is pretty rad.</p>
        <p>I like the questions that the approach of the exhibition
        opens, but I don’t like how I’m left alone with them.</p>
