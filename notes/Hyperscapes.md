# Hyperscapes
So I visited the Hyperspaces exhibition (https://kornhausforum.ch/ausstellung/hyperscapes). tl;dr: I enjoyed the works presented but I didn't like the exhibition much… if that makes any sense.

I missed the curational reflexion. As presented, it seemed to me as if somebody had a good idea (Virtual landscape as a place of longing), and then placed some works more or less related to that into a room. The curational theme/exhibition guidance is rather weird and based on *states of perception* as well as a topographic map that was enhanced through DALL-E (…no comment). The exhibition opens up with landscape paintings, but then doesn't delve on the difference of landscape portrayal in those paintings and new media. Worse even, there is no reflexion on the specifics of video games. Within the given setting they are treated more or less as video projections. The aspects of interaction and participation are left to the visitor to ponder upon.

Sadly the two VR installations didn't work because of some technical issues. Except for Deer Hunter and Terra Nil all works focused on 3d. That said, I really enjoyed playing Deer Hunter as an artwork on landscape meditation. And playing Ten Lands (https://melaniecourtinat.com/Ten-Lands) on such a big display is pretty rad.

I like the questions that the approach of the exhibition opens, but I don't like how I'm left alone with them.
