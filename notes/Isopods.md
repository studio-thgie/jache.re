# Isopods

## Schedule
### Feeding
1x a week some veggie/mushroom/fruit and 1x week some specialised food or dry (dog food, fish flakes)

### Misting
> If I notice the isopods are huddling on the wet side, I increase the misting frequency or amount until they stop huddling on the moist side. Conversely, if I notice them huddling on the dry side, I decrease the misting until they stop huddling on the dry side.

Some say daily, some say weekly.

## Impressions
Springtails, lots of them.
