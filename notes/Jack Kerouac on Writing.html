        <blockquote>
        <p>“Remember above all things, Kid, that to write is not
        difficult, not painful, that it comes out of you with ease, that
        you can whip up a little tale in no time, that when you are
        sincere about it, that when you want to impress a truth, it is
        not difficult, not painful, but easy, graceful, full of smooth
        power, as if you were a writing machine with a store of
        literature that is boundless, enormous, endless, and rich. For
        it is true; this is so. Do not forget it in your gloomier
        moments. Make your stuff warm, drive it home…don’t mind critics,
        don’t mind the stuffy academic theses of scholars, they don’t
        know what they’re taking about, they’re way off the track,
        they’re cold; you’re warm, you’re red hot, you can write all
        day, you know what you know…you remember that, Kid, and when you
        feel as if you cannot write, as if it is no use, as if life is
        no good, read this over and realize that you can do a lot of
        good in this world by turning out truths like these, by
        spreading warmth, by trying to preach living for life’s sake,
        not the intellectual way, but the warm way, the way of love, the
        way which says: Brothers, I greet you with open arms, I accept
        your frailties, I offer you my frailties, let us gather and run
        the gamut of rich human existence. Remember, Kid, the ease, the
        grace, the glory, the greatness of your art; remember it, never
        forget. Remember passion. Do not forget, do not forsake, do not
        forget. It is there, the order and the purpose; there is chaos,
        but not in you, not way down deep in your heart, no chaos, only
        ease, grace, beauty, love, greatness… Do not forget it, Kid, do
        not forget it; please, please Kid, do not forget yourself; save
        that, save that, preserve yourself; turn out those mean little
        old tales by the dozens, it is easy, it is grace…drive it home,
        sell truth, for it needs to be sold. Remember, Kid, what I say
        to you tonight; never forget it, read this over in your gloomier
        moments and never, never forget…never, never, never
        forget…please, please, Kid please…”</p>
