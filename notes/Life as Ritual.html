        <ol type="1">
        <li><strong>Ritual is not about stale traditionalism.</strong> The teachings of Confucius’s <em>Analects</em> are about submission to life-as-ritual, not about enforcing the status quo or obeying fusty old rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Ritual is about reverence.</strong> Treat the world around you seriously, with respect for its rhythms and patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Everything is ritual</strong>. We shouldn’t restrict the scope of ritual to activities such as weddings and funerals. The world is a sacred space with its own patterns, and we can ritually harmonise with it at all times.</li>
        <li><strong>Ritual is even better than good habits</strong>. Habits are inflexible, and that’s a liability. Confucian ritual is flexible, and performing it properly entails willingness to adjust yourself to different contexts.</li>
        <li><strong>Never stop studying</strong>. Except for a few geniuses, seeing the patterns of the world can be tough. Reading widely and asking questions when you’re confused is, itself, part of ritual.</li>
        <li><strong>You can’t fake it until you make it</strong>. Without cultivating sincerity and kindness, your rituals will be hollow. A fake ritual is not a ritual at all, no matter how much it looks like one.</li>
