        <p>Terike Haapoja in FB wrote this nice text about it:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Watched this last night. It’s a strange nature documentary,
        because it lacks all the scientific data and marvel about the
        biological features that’s typical to the genre. But then I
        understood that it’s not really about the octopus (that they’re
        pretty amazing is not big news) or even about interspecies
        friendship (there are documented cases that are much more
        spectacular and out of the ordinary than this) - but it’s about
        this guy and what happens to him when he opens up to the
        relationship with the octopus in a way that allows for them to
        become friends.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It reminded me of how someone (I think the primatologist
        Barbara Smutts) wrote about personhood and that it’s not
        something anyone has before the encounter, but something that
        emerges_in_the encounter. And how Matthew Calarco wrote in
        reference to Levinas that if the other is radically beyond
        knowing, and the “face” that triggers the ethical encounter has
        no predetermined features, then not only human face but
        literally anything living can suddenly appear to us as a “face”
        that utters ‘don’t kill me’. And how Elisa Aaltola writes about
        empathy and reaching beyond skepticism that only when we
        approach the other without any wants or expectations can we form
        an ethical relationship with them.<br />
        I’m also thinking that this guy was able to encounter the
        octopus in this way when he himself was in a stage on some kind
        of vulnerability (after burnout, it seems) and went in there not
        to get something for himself but just to co-exist. So I think
        this is a beautiful record of what happens when we open up like
        this and that it’s possible for anyone to form these kinds of
        deep bonds across all kinds of ways of being.”</p>
