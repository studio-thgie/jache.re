# My Writer's Type
## Evaluation University of Frankfurt [^1]
### Adventurer: The way is the goal
You like to write and develop your ideas or the structure of your text while you are writing.  Advantages of your way of working are, for example:  

- You write freely and light-heartedly and rarely get bored.
- You are open to new ideas, which you often find while writing.
- You can quickly see that you have achieved something.

Some of the risks that your writing brings with it are:  

- You easily digress from the actual topic.
- You have to allow more time for revision.
- You do not see the end.

## TU Dresden [^2]
### Type of writing: structure creator  
Structure creators are people who aim to produce as much text as quickly as possible and whose text  structure is created while writing. For this type of writer, it is easy to start writing early on in the process,  produce a lot of text and to work through the information by writing. This kind of working process  appears to be very flexible and inspiring. On the other hand, there is the danger of losing focus, since it takes a lot of time for the structure to manifest, or lose the overview over the huge amount of material and ideas at some point. Often, structure creators only write the introduction after finishing the main part of the text.

- To counter losing focus while working: Choose a certain point of  
your content and only work on that for a defined amount of  
time.
- To counter being too elaborate in your text: Choose your  
resources that you want to use to present this certain point  
before you start working on it.
- To avoid too much pressure at the end: Work on the final  
revision of your text together with friends.
