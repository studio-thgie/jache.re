        <p>I guess I’m good with the second and third point. Not so much
        on the reflexive part, the reasons for notes and the revisiting.
        Have to practice that.</p>
        <h2 id="-take-smart-notes">## Take Smart Notes</h2>
        <h3 id="step-1-read-and-take-smart-notes"><strong>Step
        1:</strong> Read and take smart notes</h3>
        <p>When working, write down your thoughts and ==the reason why
        you are taking particular note of a piece of information==. This
        way, you will better understand the focus and reasoning behind
        the information you jot down. Even better, summarize the
        information and write it in your own words as much as you
        can.</p>
        <h3
        id="step-2-rewrite-your-notes-for-the-zettelkasten-"><strong>Step
        2:</strong> Rewrite your notes for the Zettelkasten </h3>
        <p>Once you have collected and summarized the information, it’s
        time to highlight some key elements. Include index information
        like the author’s name, book location, or the link URL. For
        longer Zettels, highlighting the learning objectives or key
        points in a bullet list might be helpful. The main point is to
        write your notes in such a way that you will easily be able to
        quickly get the gist of the material when you come across it
        again.</p>
        <h3 id="step-3-adding-a-structure-to-your-zettel"><strong>Step
        3:</strong> Adding a structure to your Zettel</h3>
        <p>The objective of using the Zettelkasten method is to make
        knowledge relationships. Add a particular #category or number-ID
        to the individual Zettels to help you link them to another in
        your system. Doing so will allow you to jump from a related idea
        or piece of information to the next without having to search
        through your archive for particular keywords.</p>
        <p>You may come to a point where your database is filled with
        Zettels, expertly organized and linked to another, but you have
        lost the overview. In this case, you can create Hub notes to
        help you. <strong>Hub notes</strong> are Zettels about a certain
        topic with subtopics. They are similar to the index or the table
        of contents. Use hub notes as a reference or index for your
        work. Write down the list of topics in your Zettelkasten with a
        description and reference number to help you find and access
        information easier and quicker.</p>
        <h3 id="step-4-ask-questions-and-review-as-a-habit"><strong>Step
        4:</strong> Ask questions and review as a habit</h3>
        <p>Note-taking or note-collecting is great, but having access to
        a significant amount of information doesn’t make you smarter.
        Ask yourself questions when analyzing the information to help
        you develop your own ideas for the content or material. Make it
        a regular habit to review information in your Zettelkasten to
        jog your memory and encourage you to see patterns and create
        connections between ideas and information.</p>
