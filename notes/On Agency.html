        <p>Putting ontological value into things, granting them the
        right of existing as their own respective complexities</p>
        <p>the complexity of all things as entangled knots in the web of
        existence humans have the duty to care and maintane things they
        created (because of the impact on the world and the respective
        complexity)</p>
        <p>In a cartesian dualism/humanism the things get equalised to
        humans if a necessary basis of it’s humanness can be attributed
        while as in animism or new materialism all things are equal from
        the beginning. There is no human exceptionalism but a flat
        ontology. Humans, animals, plants and things don’t need to be
        ethically divided. They are put into social relations.</p>

        <p>The endangered species act is pretty clear that when a
        species is endangered it does not matter if we can find why that
        species is valuable or not. The species is valuable - according
        to the Endangered Species Act - just because.</p>

        <p>For example, one of the most robust psychological phenomena
        in behavioural economics is the endowment effect, first reported
        in 1991 by Richard Thaler, Daniel Kahneman and Jack Knetsch.
        There are various versions of the effect, but probably the most
        compelling is the observation that we value identical goods (eg,
        coffee mugs) equally until one becomes owned, whereupon the
        owner thinks that his or her mug is worth more than a potential
        buyer is willing to pay. What is interesting is that this effect
        is more pronounced in cultures that promote greater independent
        self-construal compared with those that promote more
        interdependent notions of the self. Again, this fits with the
        extended-self concept where we are defined by what we own
        exclusively.</p>
