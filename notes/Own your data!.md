# Own your data!

Data that you are producing needs to be valued as work in the current capitalist environment. So if you didn't get paid for it, you still (have to) own it. It also makes it easier to shift tools and setups if you own your data. Owning data means being freely able to read, move and copy, transform, or delete it.
