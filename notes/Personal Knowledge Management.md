# Personal Knowledge Management

My most important rule regarding this: _Keep it simple_. There are tons of sources out there; PARA, L Y T, ROAM, Bear etcetcetc. But in the end it boils down to this: no system of PKM can replace practice, it can only help structuring your practice.

So, just start writing and see to it that you keep on doing it. You can start organising along the way.

## Zettelkasten

Write atomized and interlinked. Every Zettel cares about one thing only and has a unique identifier  (the filename or alpha-numerical ID). The identifier is used to link between the notes.

Zettlr[^1] or Obsidian[^2] are built like that, on top of a an archive of markdown text-files. Which I personally prefer for practical as well as ideological reasons. Obsidian has the advantage that it automatically updates the links when you change a filename. Since I prefer human-readable links, I prefer Obsidian for the management of the notes, but Zettlr for it's integration of an academic writing workflow (referencing and export). That might change when Obsidian is able to handle my Zotero reference database.

## Structure of a note
- The title should be something like a very short sentence; More then just two nouns but less then being wrapped within your views. Like `Technologische Artefakte ohne Narrative` or `The Design Process and its Stages`.
