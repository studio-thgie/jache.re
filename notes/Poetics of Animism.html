        <p>Poetics is a difficult term to use in a research project. But
        bear with me</p>
        <p>→ oxford: having an imaginative or sensitively emotional
        style of expression. → merian-webster: having or expressing the
        qualities of poetry (as through aesthetic or emotional
        impact).</p>
        <p>Poetics is closely related to literature and writing and as
        such it is related to communication. In this, it attempts to go
        beyond the mere transportation of information. Poetics tries to
        create relation not only on practical level, but also by
        conveying that which can be hardly put into words - beauty,
        emotion, experience. In short, those things we can probably
        agree on to make for a better living.</p>
        <p>Speculative or critical design is heavily inspired by
        literature and it’s ability to create the fantastic.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Of all these areas of research, it is literature and fine
        art that offer the most promising sources of inspiration. They
        can push the notion of fiction to the extreme, going well beyond
        logical worlds and more pragmatic world building.” <span

        </blockquote>
        <p>Speculative design is about extrapolating from the present
        into a possible and desirable future through different
        methodologies of creating the fantastic.</p>
        <p>The poetics of animism is the aesthetic force of giving form
        to an otherwise fantastic epistemology. Again, animism is
        understood as the process of highten the ontological status of a
        thing from passive materia to a non-human person. One could be
        quick to dismiss animism as a naive make-belief, but since the
        renewed interest in new materialism we have a beautiful
        theoretical foundation for such an epistemology. We do not have
        a practice.</p>
        <p>Animism does not only enable form to be given to this, it
        also makes these forms approachable for humans, through
        emotions, intuition and stories. Animism in design could be a
        step away from use cases to narratives.</p>
