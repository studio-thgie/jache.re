        <p>This is a knot in a particular thread I followed for quite a
        while now. I’d like to share this knot with you as an entry
        point to a larger web of things I would love to keep present in
        the world.</p>
        <p>This text is an attempt in wording out a narrative I follow
        to access the world. It’s about how I relate to the world or
        better said, how I am of relations within the world. It’s about
        embracing complexity and being able to experience the beauty of
        it.</p>

        <h2 id="how-i-got-here">How I got here</h2>
        <p>It probably started during a brief stay in Tokyo in the year
        2000. We just hardly survived the millennium bug and I fulfilled
        one of my childhood dreams to visit Japan. My grandfather left
        me some Deutsche Mark, which I could dispose of when reaching
        18. And that’s what I did. My best friend and I booked a flight
        and the first few nights in a hostel. Somehow I managed to mess
        about the timezone and booked one day to early. Of course they
        canceled our reservation, which we got to know when we arrived …
        they let us stay for one night anyway and what started was a
        wonderful micro odyssey through Tokyo.</p>
        <p>One of the things that really fascinated me, was the local’s
        relationship to space. Next to be super clean and tidy I got the
        feeling, that spatial relationships are very personal and
        respectful. Especially in shared or public places. There was a
        small public place with a mini park in the middle near Shinjuku.
        It was just some fenced of gras, bushes and maybe three or four
        trees. Inside that mini park, there was a homeless person living
        in a cardboard hut. The person put the shoes outside of the
        fence next to a neatly packed away broom.</p>
        <p>And then there were numerous encounters with those small
        hideaway shinto shrines. It was my first exchange with alien
        spirituality. Although my parents being atheists, I haven’t seen
        much else than christian culture by then. They fascinated me, I
        loved them. They felt like little places of shared embedding
        into the respective places of living and being. And I certainly
        had no vocabulary like that back then.</p>
        <h2 id="animism">Animism</h2>
        <p>What followed was a very interested inquiry in the nature of
        animism. The notion to anthropomorphise the environment made a
        lot of sense to me. Starting out from simple acts of giving name
        to that you wish to interact with, out of fear or curiosity, to
        producing a full canon of characters which symbolise different
        aspects of what you encounter, humans tried to access the
        non-human and be with it.</p>
        <p>A paganist once told me the following: Early farmers in the
        alps had their nature-culture divide the other way around.
        Nature was a unsteady, ever-changing danger and human
        settlements, especially the fireplace, was the eternal safe
        space. Most early animistic cultures had a dangerous vice-versa
        to deal with. Animism provided a kind of language or framework
        to do so.</p>
        <p>A bit later I stumbled upon the paper of Nurit Bird-David: <a
        href="http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Mail/xmcamail.2012_08.dir/pdfFNa83UDbvD.pdf">“Animism”
        Revisited: Personhood, Environment, and Relational
        Epistemology</a> (<a
        href="https://doi.org/10.1086/200061">DOI</a>). The redefinition
        of animism, as found in this paper, was very inspiring. Animism
        is, simply said, a type of epistemology in where you are more
        interested in the relation to something then in the thing
        itself.</p>
        <p>Relational epistemology within the context of animism means,
        that there is social practice with the environment or at least
        with the parts one deems to be of importance. It also means that
        personhood is constructed not out of yourself, but only in
        relationship to others. Something that is mirrored, in my
        understanding, by Rosi Braidottis nomadic subjectivity.</p>
        <p>Bluntly, I don’t believe in spirits, souls and gods the least
        — not as concrete separate entities as they’re positioned within
        western religion. Everything else would be a lie. But I do
        believe, that language and aesthetics form us and form our
        access to the world. And this is the context within which
        animism has to be understood, when I use this term.</p>
        <h2 id="multispecies-entanglement">Multispecies
        Entanglement</h2>
        <p>In contemporary anthropology and philosophy (correct me if
        I’m wrong please) there has been a discourse, from the likes of
        Donna Haraway and Jane Bennett and to a lesser degree, for
        example by Timothy Morton and the OOO crew. The multispecies
        discourse is about the grander narrative of being. It’s not
        actively trying to be anthropo-decentric, as core OOO is, and
        focuses more on the entanglement of everything that is. The <a
        href="http://www.multispecies-salon.org/">Multispecies Salon</a>
        is a good entry point to get a grasp of the range of the
        field.</p>
        <p>What is very important, I believe, is the fact that a lot of
        the multispecies discourse is championed by feminist thought.
        Staying with the Trouble by Donna Haraway has it’s heritage in
        her Cyborg Manifest, in which she tried to create new space for
        feminist positions by shifting and changing the techno-natural
        borders. Timothy Morton’s new book ‘Humankind’ has ‘
        <em>Solidarity with Nonhuman People’</em> as it’s subtitle and
        María Puig de la Bellacasa’s latest work is ‘Matters of Care:
        Speculative Ethics in More Than Human Worlds’.</p>
        <p>The multispecies discourse is actually highly feminist, in
        it’s contemporary intersectional form, and political without the
        hitherto baggage of politics and theory. The multispecies
        discourse is looking at ontologies through whatever is touching
        us, humans, in one or another way. But let’s leave that for
        another time…</p>

        <h2 id="recipe">Recipe</h2>
        <p>The following is a simple approach to animistic, multispecies
        entanglement awareness practice through fostering relation to
        place. It is deeply inspired by the <a
        href="https://eatyoursidewalk.org/products/eat-your-sidewalk-cookbook">Eat
        Your Sidewalk Cookbook</a>/<a
        href="https://eatyoursidewalk.org/products/the-codebook">Codebook</a>of
        which I copied a small excerpt at the end of this text (<em>Eat
        your Sidewalk Codebook Manifesto</em>). If you feel touched by
        this text in any positive way, you should definitive get
        yourself a copy of the book. It’s awesome.</p>
        <p>I also like to add four attitudes I found to be of beauty and
        importance that go hand in hand with this recipe. I have added
        quotes and sources to the end of this text (<em>Entangling
        Attitudes</em>).</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Vinciane Despret’s <strong><em>politeness</em></strong></li>
        <li>Hannah Arendt’s <strong><em>go visiting</em></strong></li>
        <li>Anna Tsing’s <strong><em>arts of noticing</em></strong></li>
        <li>Minakata Kumagusu’s <strong><em>tact</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Working this recipe will no yield a finished and polished
        result, something that is right or correct. Instead it intends
        to foster entangling ontology and relational epistemology. An
        emotional and aesthetic understanding that the world is a
        complex place and that you are always a accomplice in it and
        that being and knowing are also and always embodied.</p>

        <p>Pick a location. It doesn’t matter what or where it is. Stick
        with it for the duration of one go, which ends when you decide
        it. Your view on that particular location will change, you will
        change, the location will change.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Mark one square meter and research what’s within. While
        doing so, reverse-engineer the threads of complexity. Think
        about, what was needed that everything is as it is now —
        including yourself.</li>
        <li>Make an inventory of the all the things you find. If you
        encounter the unknown, like plants or animals and insects, get
        to know them.</li>
        <li>What kind of power structures do the insects, stones and you
        share?</li>
        <li>Create and share stories of the location and with your
        people</li>
        <li>Regularly visit your location, has the inventory changed?
        You could try for 30 days, every day, for 15 minutes at the same
        time.</li>
        <li>Don’t only observe, try to interact with and to become part,
        be part of the location.</li>
        <li>Arrange the things you’ll find at the location. For example,
        sort all stones by size. What other non-destructive
        interventions can you think of? Is arranging already
        destructive? Is being there violence?</li>
        <li>Of course, there needs to be some fermentation going on:
        make a sourdough starter, sauerkraut or some kvass at your
        location. Give the local microbial world a change to enter the
        food your preparing by using cheesecloth as well as learning
        about bad molds</li>
        <li>Create a makeshift shrine for the location. Let the shrine
        be open for co-creation and -usage for everyone, human and
        nonhuman</li>
        <li>Leave the location for a long time. Return to it one day and
        treat it like a lost love or a 10$ bill you found in a pair of
        unwashed pants. Celebrate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This recipe is by no means to be followed strictly nor is it
        finished. It’s a small thing, compared to what depth you find
        within the <a

        stattfindet, was in dieser Welt auftauchen kann und was es

        <h3 id="vinciane-desprets-politeness">Vinciane Despret’s
        politeness</h3>
        <p>“Referring both to her own practice for observing scientists
        and also to the practices of ethologist Thelma Rowell observing
        her Soay sheep, Despret affirmed “a particular epistemological
        position to which I am committed, one that I call a virtue: the
        virtue of politeness.” In every sense, Despret’s cultivation of
        politeness is a curious practice. She trains her whole being,
        not just her imagination, in Arendt’s words, “to go visiting.”
        Visiting is not an easy practice; it demands the ability to find
        others actively interesting, even or especially others most
        people already claim to know all too completely, to ask
        questions that one’s interlocutors truly find interesting, to
        cultivate the wild virtue of curiosity, to retune one’s ability
        to sense and respond — and to do all this politely! What is this
        sort of politeness? It sounds more than a little risky.
        Curiosity always leads its practitioners a bit too far off the
        path, and that way lie stories.”</p>

        <p>“Critical thinking is possible only where the standpoints of
        all others are open to inspection. Hence, critical thinking,
        while still a solitary business, does not cut itself off from
        ‘all others.’ To be sure, it still goes on in isolation, but by
        the force of imagination it makes the others present and thus
        moves in a space that is potentially public, open to all sides;
        in other words, it adopts the position of Kant’s world citizen.
        To think with an enlarged mentality means that one trains one’s
        imagination to go visiting.”</p>

        <p>Progress is a forward march, drawing other kinds of time into
        its rhythms. Without that driving beat, we might notice other
        temporal patterns. Each living thing remakes the world through
        seasonal pulses of growth, lifetime reproductive patterns, and
        geographies of expansion. Within a given species, too, there are
        multiple time-making projects, as organisms enlist each other
        and coordinate in making landscapes. The curiosity I advocate
        follows such multiple temporalities, revitalizing description
        and imagination. This is not a simple empiricism, in which the
        world invents its own categories. Instead, agnostic about where
        we are going, we might look for what has been ignored because it
        never fit the time line of progress.</p>

        <h3 id="minakata-kumagusus-tact">Minakata Kumagusu’s tact</h3>
        <p>“Things in the universe,” wrote Minakata, “naturally proceed
        smoothly without being conscious as long as one can apprehend
        the reasons for such things. . . . A discovery is . . . nothing
        but understanding things in the universe, as they are, through .
        . . <em>encountering tact</em>”. The formulation “as long as one
        can apprehend the reasons” (<em>yoki kotowari ni sae
        tsukamaeatareba</em>) implies both that one apprehends and that
        one <em>is apprehended by</em> reasons. Like a hunter wandering
        in a forest, tracing faint signs of game, tact entails trying to
        sense the “reasons” of nonhuman orders. To respond to the
        slightest sign, the hunter must <em>wait while searching</em>,
        all the while staying attentive to the motions and sounds of the
        world. Thus, tact can be seen as the limit point where that
        which one has consciously learned encounters worldly surprises
        that go beyond this learning. It concerns the cultivation of a
        receptive attitude toward the surprises of (nonhuman) things;
        even things that might lie hidden in plain view.</p>

        <p>The following is taken from the <a
        href="https://eatyoursidewalk.org/products/the-codebook">Codebook</a>.</p>
        <p>A. GETTING ENTANGLED</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Walk your sidewalk everyday. Cross boundaries. Sense
        differently. Meet &amp; dialog</li>
        <li>Identify &amp; track: plants, animals, interactions, &amp;
        patterns</li>
        <li>Begin within your body. Join with plants, animals, insects,
        fungi. &amp; bacteria, via foraging, hunting &amp; eating</li>
        <li>Re-distribute. Pickle, ferment, dry, smoke &amp; can. Use
        processes, forces &amp; capacities of abundance</li>
        <li>Work via consensus, &amp; generosity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>THE THREE REFUSALS</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Actively refuse pre-existing boundaries (begin w/ self)</li>
        <li>Refuse envisioning things as resources</li>
        <li>Avoid the ideological mindset of scarcity. Organize via
        plentitude (those pesky weeds)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>B. ASSEMBLING</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Eating a Dandelion will help flourising. Let discoveries
        &amp; curiosity lead</li>
        <li>Follow what you eat into new engagements</li>
        <li>Become dependent. (Make a fermented cider using your saliva
        &amp; local fruit, for example)</li>
        <li>Give those who assemble a voice (bats, bees, bacteria…)</li>
        <li>What new processes, qualities &amp; capacities emerge via
        these joinings? Try water + flour + your house = yeast (bread) =
        gift</li>
        <li>Make new tools (to dig, to cook, to share, to transplant, to
        co-produce with insects…)</li>
        <li>Use tools to activate &amp; stabilize new
        qualities/possibilities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>C. MAKING A PIRATE PROJECT</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Develop a Pirate (Pilot) Project. Start with your
        sidewalk</li>
        <li>Clear heavy metals with lambsquarter? Remove parking lots
        with knotweed? A monthly block dinner?</li>
        <li>Follow &amp; change as the project changes &amp; changes
        you</li>
        <li>Test &amp; be generous. Take delöight in other’s
        projects</li>
        <li>Get multi-species feedback</li>
        <li>If it does not work? Celebrate &amp; re-entangle</li>

        <p>D. THE EMERGENCE OF A COMMON(ING)</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Take into account what is emerging across these sidewalk
        network meetings</li>
        <li>Co-evolve intra-activity across meetings</li>
        <li>Work for &amp; from these emergent relations</li>
        <li>Test &amp; reinforce ways to hold these in common</li>
        <li>Sense the agency of your messy evolving sidewalk system,
        give it voice</li>
        <li>Celebrate often</li>
        <li>Don’t short circuit what’s emerging by defaulting to
        having</li>
        </ul>
        <p>E. DYNAMIC EVALUATING</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Commons emerging = unfamiliar evolving boundaries</li>
        <li>Commoning: working within an emergent set of tolerances
        &amp; evolving as a relational system</li>
        <li>Become (intra)dependent upon what emerges. Eating urban
        Geese could begin this</li>
        <li>Sense and respekt the dynamics of the common’s abilities
        (boundaries)</li>
        <li>Develop the common’s ability to shift through multiple
        states</li>
        <li>Collaboration &amp; reciprocity = (emergent) agents evolve
        ways to live <em>of</em> a set of relations</li>
        <li>Multiply &amp; celebrate different possibilities</li>
        <li>Respect, &amp; test the limits of your commoning
        processes</li>
        <li>Develop a system of reciprocity (relationality) = the agents
        of the collective are accountable</li>
        <li>Transform governance to recognize your commoning</li>
        <li>Co-evolve with other emerging commons</li>
        <li>Keep eating your transforming sidewalk!</li>
