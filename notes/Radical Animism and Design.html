        Design</h1>
        <p>I want us to understand, that these things are us and most
        belong to us. I want us to understand, that these things have
        the ontological rights, to exist and be treated good.</p>
        <p>I want us to remove the notion of <em>products</em> and thus
        the notion of <em>users</em>. There are only people, human as
        well as non-human, which are in in constant emerging dances
        which each other.</p>
        <p>I want us to understand, that capitalism is nothing, but that
        the most important drivers of our world is non-paid work (of
        developers, marginalized, care-work, etc)</p>
        <p>The spirit within lets us see the egregore of us.</p>
