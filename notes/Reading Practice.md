# Reading Practice

There are generally speaking two modes of reading. One is for literature on is the relaxed reading, allowing oneself to immerse in the text. The second is a kind of economic reading, a mode that is about extracting information, reflecting on the gained knowledge, and work it into your own writing. The latter is a very active way of working with text and needs some methodological procedure.

## Economic reading
- define reading goals
- define what the results of the reading should be
- define what will be read; all of the text, parts, just the summary

### Wolfgang Zielke on reading methods
- *orientational* or *cursory* reading skims the text; structural such as titles, overviews or summaries take centre stage
- *selective* reading focuses on specific information
- *structuring* reading proceeds slowly and thoroughly

Another approach is the SQ3R Method: **S**urvey, **Q**uestion, **R**ead, **R**ecite, **R**eview
