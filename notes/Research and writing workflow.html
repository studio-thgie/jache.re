        <p>I’m pretty happy with my research and writing setup. It works
        well enough for me to make recommendations to people. Here, I
        try to write-up my current workflow and the tools involved.</p>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>In research, you always collect, manage, and consume material
        such as scientific papers, other textual material, images and
        videos etc. Guided by your inquiry, research question or
        project, you produce something new out of the collected and
        worked on material and your own thoughts. In the last stage, you
        want to hand your new thing over to other people.</p>
        <p>I have four main tools in my setup:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Obsidian</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tropy.org/">Tropy</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of them are free. Zotero and Obsidian offer paid services
        that you generally don’t need, except if you want to make your
        life easier or become a power user. Zotero, Tropy and
        hypothes.is are even open-source. Something I always like.
        Open-source software enables data sustainability.</p>
        <p>In Obsidian you’ll work with markdown files, which are
        basically just slightly structured plain text files that you
        have on your own computer. Zotero works with a database that you
        can sync to an online service. It has fantastic export
        abilities. hypothes.is is also a service, and has a vibrant
        community, as well as some great export functionalities. Tropy
        is an application to collect and manage images that you need for
        your research.</p>
        <p>There is only simple rule in place, that pretty much defines
        what tools I’m using: <a href="notes/Own%20your%20data!.html">Own
        your data!</a></p>

        <h2 id="explanations-of-the-setup">Explanations of the
        setup</h2>
        <h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>
        <p>With the Zotero and hypothes.is plugins in place, you can
        easily start to collect websites, references and PDFs or
        annotate online articles.</p>
        <h3 id="zotero">Zotero</h3>
        <p>In Zotero you collect references to things you want to keep,
        read, work through, cite in your texts, etc. The references can
        either just point to another place, like a bookmark, but they
        can also contain attachments. These attachments are usually
        either a locally saved snapshot of a website, in case it ever
        goes offline, but you still need the content, or in most cases,
        a PDF of the text you want to read.</p>
        <p>When you do academic writing, it is best practice to
        reference your sources that you built upon. As is typical with
        an academic process, this can be tedious and painful. Zotero
        tries to take the pain out of it. You can have a folder with all
        your sources, for example, and with a few clicks have a proper
        formatted list of sources that you can paste into your
        document.</p>
        <p>Zotero is also a wonderful tool to read and annotate PDFs.
        Have a look at the <a
        href="https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader">PDF Reader and
        Note Editor</a> guide. It syncs with mobile, so you could also
        read on your phone or tablet. I usually make all reading notes
        in Zotero, even if I don’t have a PDF. I simply add the book as
        a reference (for example via <a
        href="https://www.worldcat.org/">worldcat.org</a>) and attach a
        reading note to it.</p>
        <h3 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h3>
        <p>This is where the magic happens. Alternatively, you could
        have a look at <a href="https://www.zettlr.com/">Zettlr</a>.
        Compared to Obsidian, it is completely open-source, and the
        developer is super sympathetic. But it’s too sluggish for me and
        the plugin ecosystem is practically non-existent, making it hard
        to extend. Obsidian is basically a text-editor with superpowers.
        One of the basic ideas is, that you can write in something and
        easily link to another file, over time building up a strong
        knowledge network.</p>
        <p>The goal is actually to get as much material as possible into
        Obsidian. This is where you spent most of your productive time.
        Going over your notes and annotations, your resources, piecing
        them all together and at last, come up with your own material.
        How exactly you work in Obsidian is up to you and a whole other
        rabbit whole I fell in several times…</p>
        <h2 id="import-notes-and-annotations">Import notes and
        annotations…</h2>
        <h3 id="from-zotero">…from Zotero</h3>
        <p>There is a good explanation under <a
        href="https://publish.obsidian.html/history-notes/01+Notetaking+for+Historians#Zotero+Integration+Setup">Notetaking
        for Historians - Zotero Integration Setup</a>. I have my own
        import template, that focuses on the notes I made during
        reading:</p>
        <pre><code># {{title}}

- [Bibliography](#bibliography)
- [Notes](#notes)
- [Abstract](#abstract)
- [Reading Notes](#reading-notes)

## Bibliography
{{bibliography}}

{% if abstractNote %}## Abstract
{{abstractNote}}{% endif %}

## Notes
{% persist &quot;notes&quot; %}{% endpersist %}
{% if markdownNotes %}{{markdownNotes}}{% endif %}

## Related
{% persist &quot;related&quot; %}{% endpersist %}</code></pre>
        <h3 id="from-websites">…from websites</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>From hypothes.is, just use the command
        <code>Hypothes.is: Sync Highlights</code>. That will sync all
        your notes and annotations that you’ve made online into your
        Obsidian files. It’s buggy at times, but mostly works as
        intended.</li>
