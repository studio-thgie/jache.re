        <p>This is the base note for a new line of inquiry that grew out
        of a reflection on what to do with my own practice in these
        times of crisis. Iâ€™m very much invested into technology,
        especially digital ones. The last 10 to 50 years have shown,
        that our collective imagination of technology does a lot of harm
        to the planet, to flora and fauna, and to ourselves. Harm that
        would not be necessary and which by far outweights the good.
        Solar Sensitivities then is an attempt to bring my own practice
        into accordance with my values.</p>

        <p>This is the original inspirational document by low-tech
        magazine: <a
        href="https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html">How
        to build a Low-Tech website: Software &amp; Hardware</a>. The
        easiest solutionâ€¦ is probably to just buy the PiJuice shield and
        solar panel. But it feels a bit to quick. I would love to learn
        just a bit more about electricity. Pidora has a good step by
        step over view on <a
        href="https://pidora.ca/how-to-build-a-solar-powered-raspberry-pi/">how
        to build a solar powered raspi server</a>. The shield has the
        ability to safely turn on and off the device. <a
        href="https://www.activecountermeasures.com/making-a-solar-powered-raspberry-pi/">This
        article by active countermeasures</a> (ðŸ™„) opts for the USB

        <p>So it seems a <a

        and how much is produced. The biggest PiJuice solar panel
        produces 44W, whereas the low-tech magazine setup has a 50 Wp
        (?) panel.</p>
        <p>I have to ask a specialist (Ramon ;)) on how some of the
        details work. Does the solar panel charge battery pack and
        server at the same time? Did I get all of the watt<a href="/notes/Solar Sensitivities.html#fn2"

        <p>The cable that come out of the panel look weird. Easy peasy,

        Just requires having the right setup :) Needed to order some
        more things. Also see <a href="/notes/Solar Sensitivities.html#Update%202022-05-09">Update

        <h3 id="update-2022-05-09">Update 2022-05-09</h3>
        <p>I bought myself a large panel (110W) and an easy MPPT. That
        is a little thing that stabilises the energy that comes out of
        the panel. Because the sun-shine fluctuates, and with it the
        energy-current, it can be problematic for the things you attach
        to the panel. This particular MPPT by revolt<a href="/notes/Solar Sensitivities.html#fn3"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> also has USB outlets, which
        is nice. If it produces to much power, maybe we can even charge
        some other devices.</p>
        <p>I do need to learn how to set up the panel now, and if I miss
        anythingâ€¦ Oook I was missing a few things.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>an MPPT should not be setup without a battery hooked up to
        it. That could damage the MPPT. So I had to order a battery as
        well</li>
        <li>The cables that came out of the solar panel are the MC4
        type. I did order proper cables into the MPPT, but they lack the
        MC4 adapters on the other end, so I had to order that as well.
        ### Update 2022-05-17 The setup works!</li>

        <figcaption aria-hidden="true">An electronic setup with a solar
        panel, a car battery, a little device called MPPT that regulates
        the power coming from the solar panel and a raspberry pi. All

        MPPT shows 13V and the raspberry pi has a red LED lit

        </figure>
        <p>The solar panel charges the car battery and that one in turn
        powers the raspberry pi server. The battery is to small to power
        the server through the night. I was a bit too cheap on that end.
        Iâ€™ll have to test if I can have the system charge a second
        battery, that Iâ€™m having laying around, that powers the server
        then. Otherwise I need to upgrade the car battery. But those I
        should be able to find used.</p>
        <h3 id="update-2022-07-10">Update 2022-07-10</h3>
        <p>I figured no good place in my home to attach the solarpanel
        in a good spot. But I might be able to put the whole system
        (panel, batteries, and server) in the community garden, where we
        have an allotment. I asked my contact and he said, theyâ€™ll
        discuss it. Here are my sketches to explain what I intend to
        do.</p>
        <p><img src="agenda/files/image%201%201.jpg" /></p>
        <h3 id="update-2022-08-08">Update 2022-08-08</h3>
        <p>I actually had a raspberry pi zero laying around! The little
        thing is more then enough to serve static files. I even have a
        little php-based application running on it next to my two static
        sites <a href="thgie.ch">thgie.ch</a> and <a
        href="jache.re">jache.re</a>. The rather small 6000AH battery
        lasts for three days more or less. I still werenâ€™t able to
        figure out where and how the solar panel will be placed.</p>
