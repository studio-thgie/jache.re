        <h1 id="thematic-analysis">Thematic analysis</h1>
        <p>Thematic analysis (TA) emphasizes identifying, analysing and
        interpreting patterns of meaning (or “themes”) within
        qualitative data. It does so mostly through coding, whereas the
        codes can be (code book, coding reliability) predefined or
        (reflexive) developed during the analysis. TA is sometimes
        claimed to be compatible with phenomenology in that it can focus
        on participants’ subjective experiences and sense-making. TA has
        a theoretical flexibility is used within realist, critical
        realist and relativist ontologies and positivist, contextualist
        and constructionist epistemologies.</p>
        <p>Coding within TA will always reflect the researchers’
        philosophical standpoints and research values. There can be
        inductive or deductive approaches. Quasi (never pure) inductive
        approaches code without trying to fit the data into pre-existing
        theories or frameworks. Deductive approaches are theory-driven
        and can involve using theory as a lens to look at the data. Of
        course, TA can combine inductive and deductive approaches.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Reflexive approaches centre organic and flexible coding
        processes - there is no code book, coding can be undertaken by
        one researcher, if multiple researchers are involved in coding
        this is conceptualised as a collaborative process rather than
        one that should lead to consensus. Individual codes are not
        fixed - they can evolve throughout the coding process, the
        boundaries of the code can be redrawn, codes can be split into
        two or more codes, collapsed with other codes and even promoted
        to themes. Reflexive approaches typically involve later theme
        development - with themes created from clustering together
        similar codes. Themes should capture shared meaning organised
        around a central concept or idea.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There is no unifiyn definition of theme within the different
        TA approaches.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>For some thematic analysis proponents, including Braun and
        Clarke, themes are conceptualised as patterns of shared meaning
        across data items, underpinned or united by a central concept,
        which are important to the understanding of a phenomenon and are
        relevant to the research question.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In the reflexive approach the researches active part in the
        creation of theme is important. Themes are not emerging (passive
        researcher) but are actively generated, created and
        constructed.</p>
        <p>Codes and themes are like bricks and brickwalls.</p>
        <p>An important tool in the process of TA is the use of a
        reflexivity journal.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The reflexivity process can be described as the researcher
        reflecting on and documenting how their values, positionings,
        choices and research practices influenced and shaped the study
        and the final analysis of the data. […] Throughout the coding
        process researchers should have detailed records of the
        development of each of their codes and potential themes.</p>
