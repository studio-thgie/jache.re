        <p>La Jachère is a small corner of the internet that wants to
        create an anti-capitalist space by practices of resting and
        letting rest. More about that approach to ideology under <a
        href="pages/about.html">about</a>. For the first Fallow Zine, la
        Jachère is interested in contributions about the following
        topics, but not limited to them.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Lazy tech or tech for the lazies</li>
        <li>Tech that falls into place, fits, is just enough</li>
        <li>Tech for rest, pause, have a break, take a breath</li>
        <li>Tech for preservation, of the status quo, of energy, of a
        moment, of equilibrium</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although being of computing origin, la Jachère understands
        technology in its broadest sense, techne. Regarding the topics,
        that can mean anything from automating code, fermenting,
        hammocks and wind energy to practices of sleeping. Basically
        every kind of technology that makes you work less, not more,
        spend less energy, not more (which is a critical aspect that
        needs reflection, because often we just externalize work and
        energy through the capitalist system).<a href="/notes/call-fallow-zine-1.html#fn1"

        <li>Deadline: I plan to publish this autumn, so feel free to
        send me stuff until then :)</li>
        <li>All languages are accepted, but we can only give feedback on
        <strong>English, German and French</strong> content at the
        moment</li>

        <h2 id="about-this-call">About this call</h2>
        <p>Technology is an essential part of being us, although it
        doesn’t make us unique. Our technology is part of our particular
        assemblage which we might call human. Our time, dubbed the
        Anthropocene, is marked by an overflow of technology. An
        overflow that actively harms and destroys our planet with its
        floras and faunas, and ourselves on individual and societal
        levels. And we are all aware of that.</p>
        <p>Our technological approaches are based on the concept of
        infinite growth, which is capitalism’s<a href="/notes/call-fallow-zine-1.html#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> fault. This is
        counterintuitive. Next to the first law of thermodynamics, the
        conservation of energy<a href="/notes/call-fallow-zine-1.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, our planetary
        flora and fauna follow a strategy of preserving energy. It’s a
        simple law, and most non-humans follow it. If there is nothing
        to do, rest. If you can improve towards more rest, it will be
        done. Somehow we humans are missing the point.</p>
        <p>What we need, urgently, are different imaginaries. We need to
        expand on our collective ways of thinking, dreaming and speaking
        about technologies. To this end, la Jachère wants to shift the
        threshold of the discourse towards “do things to do nothing”. We
        would love to collect, archive and publish practices and
        thoughts that go in that direction, as outlined by the topics in
        the beginning.</p>
        <h2 id="material">Material</h2>
        <p>You can send in every kind of text- or image-based format.
        From essays to illustrations, to poems and snippets of code to
        gifs and maps and links. If it doesn’t go against the standards
        mentioned further below, we will accept it :) The material will
        be worked into two ’zines, one digital and one printable. The
        digital will be published on la Jachère and the printable
        offered for download.</p>
        <p>We will not accept material that is racist, sexist,
        homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, ableist, or material that
        uses gratuitous sex and violence for shock value. These subjects
        can be present in a work if discussed tastefully and with
        respect for others, but never to marginalize a group of
        people.<a href="/notes/call-fallow-zine-1.html#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
        <p>We would prefer to release all material under open source,
        copyleft or copyfair licenses. If you are unsure what that
        entails the <a
        href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/">Creative
        Commons</a> is a good and easy way to start.</p>
        <h2 id="money-talk">Money Talk</h2>
        <p>All work done on Jachère and Fallow Zine as well as all
        infrastructural costs are unfunded and voluntarily. We can’t
        give you money for your contribution at this moment. If you are
        in dire need of financial assistance, please contact us in any
        case, and we can work something out.</p>
