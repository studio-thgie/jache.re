# Call for entries
## Fallow Zine 1
La Jachère is a small corner of the internet that wants to create an anti-capitalist space by practices of resting and let rest. More under [about](about.md). For the first Fallow Zine, la Jachère is interested in contributions about the following topics, but not limited to them. 

- Lazy tech or tech for the lazies
- Tech that falls into place, fits, is just enough
- Tech for rest, pause, have a break, taking a breath
- Tech for preservation, of the status quo, of energy, of a moment, of equilibrium

Although being of computing origin, la Jachère understands technology in its broadest sense, techne. Regarding the topics, that can mean anything from automating code, fermenting, hammocks and wind energy to sleeping. 

- Deadline: **21. June 2022**
- All languages accepted, but we can only give feedback on  **English, German and French** content at the moment

## About this call
Technology is an essential part of being us, although it doesn't make us unique. Our technology is part of our particular assemblage which we might call human. Our time, dubbed the Anthropocene, is marked by a overflow of technology. An overflow that actively harms and destroys our planet with its floras and faunas, and ourselves on individual and societal levels. And we are all aware of that. 

Our technological approaches are based on the concept of infinite growth, which is definitely capitalism's fault. This is counterintuitive. Next to the first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy[^1], our planetary flora and fauna follows a strategy of preserving energy. It's a simple law, and most non-humans follow it. If there is nothing to do, rest. If you can improve towards more rest, it will be done. Somehow we're missing the point of this. 

Lines of thought that actively go against the aforementioned disastrous approach of infinite growth is computing within limits with all its epistemological sisters. In terms of practices we can expand on these discourses with such practices as acts of hacking, frugal engineering and jughaad, or care and maintenance approaches. 

What we further need, urgently, are different imaginaries. We need to expand on our collective ways of thinking, dreaming and speaking about technologies. To this end, la Jachère wants to shift the threshold of the discourse towards "do things to do nothing". We would love to collect, archive and publish practices and thoughts that go into that direction, as outlined by the topics in the beginning. 

## Material
You can send in every kind of text- or image based format. From essays, to illustrations, to poems and snippets of code to gifs and maps and links. 

The material will be worked into two 'zines, one digital and one printable. The digital will be published on la Jachère and the printable offered for download here and on itch.io. 

We will not accept material that is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, or ableist, or material that uses gratuitous sex and violence for shock value. These subjects can be present in a work if discussed tastefully and with respect for others, but never for the purpose of marginalizing a group of people.[^2]

We would prefer to release all material under the [ACAC](LICENSE.md) license. You can ask to release your material under any other open source, copyleft or copyfair license, without stating any reason. 

## Money Talk
All work done on Jachère and Fallow Zine as well all infrastructural costs are unfunded and on a voluntary basis. We can't give you money for your contribution at this moment. If you are in dire need of financial assistance, please contact us in any case, and we can work something out.
