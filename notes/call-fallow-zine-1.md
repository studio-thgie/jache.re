# Call for entries
## Fallow Zine 1
La Jachère is a small corner of the internet that wants to create an anti-capitalist space by practices of resting and letting rest. More about that approach to ideology under [about](pages/about.md). For the first Fallow Zine, la Jachère is interested in contributions about the following topics, but not limited to them. 

- Lazy tech or tech for the lazies
- Tech that falls into place, fits, is just enough
- Tech for rest, pause, have a break, take a breath
- Tech for preservation, of the status quo, of energy, of a moment, of equilibrium

Although being of computing origin, la Jachère understands technology in its broadest sense, techne. Regarding the topics, that can mean anything from automating code, fermenting, hammocks and wind energy to practices of sleeping. Basically every kind of technology that makes you work less, not more, spend less energy, not more (which is a critical aspect that needs reflection, because often we just externalize work and energy through the capitalist system).[^1]

- Deadline: I plan to publish this autumn, so feel free to send me stuff until then :)
- All languages are accepted, but we can only give feedback on  **English, German and French** content at the moment
- Send your material or inquiries to [adrian@thgie.ch](mailto:adrian@thgie.ch)

## About this call
Technology is an essential part of being us, although it doesn't make us unique. Our technology is part of our particular assemblage which we might call human. Our time, dubbed the Anthropocene, is marked by an overflow of technology. An overflow that actively harms and destroys our planet with its floras and faunas, and ourselves on individual and societal levels. And we are all aware of that. 

Our technological approaches are based on the concept of infinite growth, which is capitalism's[^2] fault. This is counterintuitive. Next to the first law of thermodynamics, the conservation of energy[^3], our planetary flora and fauna follow a strategy of preserving energy. It's a simple law, and most non-humans follow it. If there is nothing to do, rest. If you can improve towards more rest, it will be done. Somehow we humans are missing the point. 

What we need, urgently, are different imaginaries. We need to expand on our collective ways of thinking, dreaming and speaking about technologies. To this end, la Jachère wants to shift the threshold of the discourse towards "do things to do nothing". We would love to collect, archive and publish practices and thoughts that go in that direction, as outlined by the topics in the beginning. 

## Material
You can send in every kind of text- or image-based format. From essays to illustrations, to poems and snippets of code to gifs and maps and links. If it doesn't go against the standards mentioned further below, we will accept it :) The material will be worked into two 'zines, one digital and one printable. The digital will be published on la Jachère and the printable offered for download. 

We will not accept material that is racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, ableist, or material that uses gratuitous sex and violence for shock value. These subjects can be present in a work if discussed tastefully and with respect for others, but never to marginalize a group of people.[^4]

We would prefer to release all material under open source, copyleft or copyfair licenses. If you are unsure what that entails the [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/) is a good and easy way to start.

## Money Talk
All work done on Jachère and Fallow Zine as well as all infrastructural costs are unfunded and voluntarily. We can't give you money for your contribution at this moment. If you are in dire need of financial assistance, please contact us in any case, and we can work something out.
