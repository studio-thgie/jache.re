# Isopods
The Jachère now officially hosts some isopods. Since small critters are amonst the main inhabitants of a fallow/Brache/jachère they absolutely deserve their own entry on this website…

Isopods are fantastic. They are really old and they don't give a crap about your opinions. [^1]

You'll find visuals of them on the *critters' corder* Instagram account: [https://www.instagram.com/critters__corner](https://www.instagram.com/critters__corner).
