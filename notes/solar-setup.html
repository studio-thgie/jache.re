        server. I wrote a bit about the software part under <a
        href="notes/jachere-publishing.html">Jachère Deployment and
        Publishing</a>. This setup works is rather small and was chosen
        to power a small server and some mobile devices. Bigger setups
        have to make different choices.</p>

        <p>All the hardware was quite cheap at the moment, especially
        the panel and the MPPT. The link to their products might break
        rather sooner than later.</p>
        <p>A solar panel doesn’t produce a stable output of power. That
        is why you’ll need something like a MPPT or solar charge
        controller, which regulate that flow of power. Otherwise, your
        attached device get damaged and break. A MPPT usually does not
        work without a battery.</p>
        <p>Make sure, that your setup fits your needs. The solar panel
        should produce enough energy to load the battery and power your
        devices, for example a server, and maybe you also want to charge
        a mobile phone or so. The battery should hold enough energy
        during times without sun (nights and cloudy weather) to power
        the server. There are calculators<a href="/notes/solar-setup.html#fn2"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> around to help with that. I
        don’t understand the concepts fully yet, but generally you need
        to know how much Ah or Wh your setup consumes. That is the
        amount of energy per hour. A Raspberry Pi 4 consumes 600mAh
        (0.6Ah) idling. My battery will be able to power this model for
        about 10h before it is empty.</p>
        <p>The cables coming from the solar panel use the MC4 connector
        style. It’s a connector system that is rainproof. I didn’t know
        it and had to buy spare connectors in order to connect to the
        MPPT. I’m still not sure if I have the correct cables, but they
        were listed under solar equipment, so let’s hope nothing burns
        down.</p>
