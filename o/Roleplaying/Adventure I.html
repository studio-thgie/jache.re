        <p>Mystery: Sister gets kidnapped by bot, leaves behind little
        audio device as only connection to her.</p>
        <p>It was the middle of summer, and my little sister, Pauline,
        had tried to follow me and my friend around for weeks. Her best
        friend was out of town and my mother tried, without much
        success, to arouse my sympathy. I had always taken care of
        Pauline, not only because of her hearing impairment, but because
        there has always been something fragile about her, as if she can
        be easily damaged or broken. However, this summer had awakened
        the desire in me to ride as far away as possible on my bike, and
        to do things on my own. When Pauline suddenly disappeared, guilt
        hit me like a blow to the stomach, and I remembered she had
        talked about meeting a new friend called Johnny.</p>
        <p>We found them at Pauline’s favorite spot. It’s a small
        opening in between some trees at the rundown parc near our
        house. We crept toward them through the tall grass as the wind
        tore at the pines. A woodpecker could be heard in the distance.
        Pauline sat on a stone and leaned forward to place a daisy chain
        on the head of a runaway robot, her new friend “Johnny.” I
        signaled to my friend Juhan to keep quiet and snuck around to
        the other side. When I looked back, Johnny was staring at me,
        its eyes narrowing to tiny black dots as it took my sister in
        its arms.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What do you do?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>(The goal is to make the player go after Johnny)</p>
        <p>[Scene: Car Street] A wild chase breaks out. Johnny has
        Pauline in his grips and goes full speed on his tracks. A robot
        going haywire is nothing to worring, they do that sometimes, but
        they never really harm anybody. But there is something about
        Johnny that makes you uneasy, something sinister. Johnny races
        into the direction of your home, down the street. Several cars
        have to move out of his ways, one almost crashes into a
        telephone-pole, but can top in the last moment. You see your
        sisters face, she doesn’t look to happy.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What do you do?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You race along the street, after Johnny, trying to evade the
        cars, which in turn are evading Johnny. - Dice for Ausweichen
        -&gt; success: getting closer -&gt; fail: seeing Johnny taking
        the curve</p>
        <p>You are getting closer - Dice for Ausdauer -&gt; success: No
        matter how much, Johnny is quicker -&gt; fial: seeing Johnny
        taking the curve</p>
        <p>[Scene: Home] You see Johnny, your sister still in his grips,
        take the turnoff into your homestreet. You follow them. Your
        street is XXX. The door to your home is open and you conclude
        that they must have gone there. Juhan finally catched up and the
        both of you enter the house.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Describe the house for me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You hear rumbling from the cellar. It’s not your favorite
        place after the horror movie that you saw last night. But your
        sister always like to hang around down there, going through your
        parents boxes. They promised adventure!</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What do you do</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last thing you see is Johnny and your sister going into
        some kind of portal. It didn’t look like he is forcing her. She
        went in there by her own choice. The portal closes. Upon
        investigation you find on of her favorite playthings, an object
        that acts as a kind of walky talky, it’s on and emitting some
        strange noises cracking and zirping.</p>
        <p>You hear your sister. She says: Everything is ok, don’t wait
        for me, just listen.</p>
        <p>You hear nothing anymore.</p>
