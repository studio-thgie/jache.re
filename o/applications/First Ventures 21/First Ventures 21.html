        <blockquote>
        <p>05 OBJECTIVES – Describe the problem to be solved,
        shortcomings of existing solutions/competitors and the business
        opportunity (market/customers) you want to pursue. What is the
        project’s value proposition? Give concrete examples, names and
        numbers.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I believe that there is untapped potential in voice assistant
        technology. I also believe that the current state of consumer
        technology hinders us from accessing this potential. This
        project’s research points to two underlying problems; Closed
        source technologies prevent trusting them and a patronizing user
        experience disenfranchises the user.</p>
        <p>This project proposes to radically rethink the interaction we
        have with technology and enable a internet of things ecosystem
        the users can trust. The goal is the development and testing of
        a prototype for a voice assistant for sensitive contexts and
        applications, like therapy settings and elderly care, by
        respecting privacy and giving control back to the user.</p>
        <p>Current business models behind voice assistants favor the
        tracking of user data in order to refine advertisement
        strategies as well as produce maps of desire. These maps record
        and predict how, where and when customers shop and consume. As
        voice assistants are often brought into the innermost sanctum of
        privacy, the family and the home, the needs of the user and the
        intentions of the manufacturers are diametralic opposites.</p>
        <p>This is the first problem that needs to be solved.
        Technologies that enter privacy-sensitive spaces, like our homes
        or therapy settings, need to be based on radical openness and
        transparent approaches.</p>
        <p>At best, concerns over privacy concentrate on the
        legal-juridical and technical aspects. From a holistic
        interaction and user experience design perspective trust is not
        something that can be earned by ticking off a terms and
        conditions page while on-boarding a service. Trust is earned
        through a practice of negotiating privacy, intimacy and consent.
        This acts of negotiating are embodied practices. When we
        communicate with another person we don’t just exchange words.
        When we engage each other we add gesture and mimic, eye contact
        and body posture. These cues help in transporting information
        and meaning.</p>
        <p>This second issue goes hand in hand with an open approach to
        the underlying technologies. Based on research done in this
        project, the user would welcome to have more control to fine
        tune their interaction and communication with the voice
        assistant. This projects proposes adding layers of interaction
        through a thing-based design approach. Additional sensors,
        gesture recognition, beacon objects as well as an alternative to
        assistant persona design would re-enable the possibilities to
        negotiate issues of privacy and intimacy, while also being
        conceived as an open system that can learn from the user or be
        customized by them.</p>
        <p>Imagine an Amazon Echo, but fully owned by you - even the
        data collected - and with an interaction design and user
        experience that holistically incorporates you as a person. Such
        an approach could enable the usage of voice assistant technology
        in privacy-sensitive context.</p>

        your business project? Have you achieved the proof of concept in
        your Bachelor/Master thesis? What is your expertise brought to
        the project?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The research body was build through classical ethnography,
        mainly observation and interviews. On top of that more recent
        netnography was applied, which was ethnographic research done
        online mainly to capture user experience reports. Besides that,
        the capturing of user journeys, coming from design research, was
        very important to paint a picture of the pain points.</p>
        <p>To work with the data I opted for a thematic analysis, with a
        reflexive approach after Braun and Clarke. This is a rather
        classic qualitative data analysis approach for mixed media
        datasets that labels the transcribed data and then builds
        overarching themes out of the codes.</p>
        <p>The last step of the research process, before going into
        prototyping, was an expert workshop. I wanted to to have the
        opinion of specialists in their respective design disciplines on
        how to improve the emotional bond between users and their voice
        assistant devices. The workshop was based on the emotional
        durable design framework, by Jonathan Chapman, as well as the
        thematic analysis.</p>
        <p>Before to doing a Masters in Design Research at the HKB in
        Bern, I studied Industrial Design in Basel. I have a working
        experience of more the 15 years as software developer, from
        freelancing to senior developer. Right now I’m engaged in a
        4-year research project at the University of Basel as a
        scientific software programmer. I had a critical engagement with
        technology and society since at least since 2014 where I
        initiated the ckster festival on contemporary hacking practices.
        I was able to share my love for technology in many workshops,
        among other at the ZHdK, the FHNW or privately organized.</p>

        <p>08 BUSINESS MODEL – Who will buy what, to which price and
        why? Describe your revenue stream and how it will sustainably
        finance the business activities after the end of the funding
        period?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I see three possibilities for revenue streams.</p>
        <p>Voice assistant as a service would be a consulting enterprise
        which, next to the development, helps implement voice assistant
        technologies in privacy-sensitive projects. It would,
        furthermore, help in conceptualizing and implementing research
        projects done with and through voice assistants, for example in
        the health sector.</p>
        <p>Voice assistant as a research platform is a development kit
        which research institutions or projects could obtain on their
        own. The costs of the kit are lower but there is no service to
        be provided.</p>
        <p>Voice assistant for the privacy-sensitive user is a spin-off
        that provides a polished experience of the device and it’s
        services to people who want to benefit from such an approach.
        These are mostly private customers who would be able and wanting
        to pay a premium price for the added privacy and
        adaptability.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>Setting off from the business model, this approach points to
        three customer strata.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Private or academic research institution that are interested
        in doing research with voice assistant technologies in
        privacy-sensitive areas, like the BFH health institutes or the
        ZAHW psychology faculty.</li>
        <li>Private or academic teams that seek to incorporate voice
        assistant technology on their own.</li>
        <li>Privacy-seeking users of voice assistants.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following partners are already committed to the
        project.</p>
        <p>crisp id, https://www.crisp-id.ch crisp id is an industrial
        design studio in Bern, Switzerland, and is specialized on
        innovative products in the intersection of market, technology
        and aesthetics. They will accompany the project in terms of
        brand and product development.</p>
        <p>Better IoT, https://betteriot.wordpress.com This
        community-led project has developed principles that are
        connected to the core-issues of this project, like privacy,
        openness, transparence and data governance. things.care will
        seek active counseling by the Better IoT community.</p>

        strategy.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The first customers would probably not bring any revenue but
        help built an applied projects portfolio. I can imagine, that we
        would get smaller research projects or even students projects
        that want to work with voice assistant technology on board and
        help them in their research endeavors through mentoring and
        technical realization. That would open up academic and research
        institutions pathways and help establish a steady flow of
        income.</p>
        <p>In a second phase this projects portfolio could expand to
        include other privacy-sensitive internet of things technologies,
        like proximity and tracking sensor for indoor tracking. An
        expansion of the portfolio, built on the same principles, would
        help expand the set of customers to other areas.</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>The most important USP is the products focus on privacy and
        intimacy, which is not only tackled from a legal-juridical or
        technological perspective, but also from interaction design and
        user experience research. Instead of feeding your most private
        data into the tracking habits of big-tech companies, this
        product and all its data belongs to you. The interaction design
        with the product not only lets you know this, but also feel and
        experience it.</p>

        <p>12 IMPACT – What lasting benefits to society is the project

        </blockquote>
        <p>Internet of thing technologies contain immense potential.
        Voice assistants are wonderful computer interfaces, but we need
        to separate them from the data tracking practices and the
        imagination of the big tech companies. They cater first and
        foremost to clients with an interest in gadgetry and consumer
        electronics. This projects seeks to do this step of separating
        concerns of interest and by that, opening up the potentials for
        further development. In the case of voice assistants there are
        two aspects which are especially valuable. As a handsfree and
        auditory interface, they provide computing access to people with
        mobility problems. As a device you talk too, voice assistants
        can be of supportive aid in therapeutic settings, for example as
        journaling tool.</p>

        <p>I’m personally driven by the believe that we can and have to
        do better in terms of consumer technology. There is untapped or
        even wasted potential hidden in the piles of electronic waste;
        in terms of mitigation of environmental problems as well as what
        technologies could do for us as people and communities, or even
        the society at large. I’m dedicated to bring out this potential
        and make it available. I also believe that the tech industry’s
        large players grew tired of trying to do their best, and that
        sustainable and healthy innovation needs to come from contextual
        and applied research.</p>
        <p>I always wanted to use my unique skillset to the betterment
        of society by giving back what I learned and can do.</p>

        <p>I’m mainly interested in learning to develop interface
        technologies into applicable use cases that are actually needed.
        I do have the necessary base skills, especially regarding
        technology, but I would love to further hone and strengthen my
        skills in design research approaches and technical realizations.
        I would also love to learn and practice ethical business
        management, for example through steward ownership. I had my fair
        share of economics and project management throughout my life,
        but didn’t had the chance to economically lead finance driven
        enterprises.</p>
