        <p>Communist Theory, Marx, proposed a progression of revolutions
        towards a better future. Thus all left vocabulary argues that
        after comes good and stays in a never ending fight.</p>
        <p>Communist Theory puts itself in a higher moral position. But
        who are you to judge the ruling classes to be bad? Isn’t it
        quite logical to pursue the status quo and thus to oppress and
        exploit? And who am I to tell you who you are? This is the
        meaning of Hegels Dialectic. The difference that causes
        friction. Because that’s what we need in the end. Friction,
        which brings the new into the world, the new we can explore and
        test it to be less frictionous for all of us. All we want in our
        emergence is entropy.</p>
        <p>But this is just on more abstraction and when the sun goes
        out and we are still on this earth no abstraction will be no
        more. Fatality. This is where logic and emotion are intertwined.
        Because we can feel happy and content. And is it thus not the
        most logical consequence to pursue those feelings? And is it not
        empirically shown, that the easiest way to achieve those
        feelings is together?</p>
