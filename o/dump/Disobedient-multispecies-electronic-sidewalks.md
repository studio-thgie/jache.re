# Disobedient multispecies electronic sidewalks.

First of all, thank you very much for Garnet for sending me a copy of Disobedient Electronics. And thank you very much Spurse for the Eat your Sidewalk project and especially the codecook.

I got both in my mail in the same week.

While *Disobedient Electronics* has a collection of great works of protest through pieces and works of electronics, I found it much more interesting to reflect on the medium of the zine in this case — especially since the *Eat your Sidewalk Codebook* is produced and distributed in the same manner.

There are ubiquitous connections to zines as a medium to meander.

But with the rise of the internet and easy publishing through plattforms and social media, information spreading went online.

I’m not a specialist on zine or zine culture. I fascinates me, that technological literate people and projects resort to a common smallest material denominator in safe documentaion: paper sent by snailmail.

Some zines also digitalize the products again:
