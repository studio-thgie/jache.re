        <p>These days I came upon the notion of private and public
        spaces online. I think there is a misconception about that.
        Private or public spaces are terms that deal with property of
        space. First of all, the internet is no physical space, that
        means you can’t own it. The german word for owning is besitzen,
        which literally translated means, to sit upon.</p>
        <p>You can’t sit upon digital spaces - you can draw arbitrary
        borders secured by … digital technology. But those borders
        aren’t physical either and don’t secure in the way we are used
        to that walls secure us.</p>
        <p>I guess, we can’t really understand what information is - not
        yet. Opensource coders long argued that Information wants to be
        free making an analogy that free code is equal to free speech. I
        don’t think Information really wants to be free. It’s free from
        the beginning. The best metaphor I can imagine is water. Water
        is free, pretty much so even. Flows around shit and stuff and
        doesn’t cost a damn thing. But if you’re stupid you pollute it
        and if your clever you bottle and sell it. That’s what the big
        players do. Since water is free they do whatever they want with
        it.</p>
        <p>Now, in comparison to water information can be treated even
        freer. We can copy information. We can pollute it without
        without the climate go all mad. But we can also bottle it an
        sell it. But unlike water, that might be polluted and now has to
        be bought in bottles, we don’t need to buy information to
        survive. Life and death don’t depend upon the internet, not yet,
        although it has a massive impact on the global society.</p>
        <p>Information can’t be owned. But it can be bottled and sold
        because we see information in the same terms as all other
        commodities. Why else would to buy a license to read a book or
        listen to a song that actually only exists in ones and zeros.
        The clever companies make you believe that you buy value, while
        they can copy a song without costs infinitely. You have to
        realize what that means. When you buy an abstraction of reality,
        pure information, you reaffirm yourself and the company that
        they have the right to do so, like bottled water.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, all the information to produce the knowledge how
        to process and control the flows of information online are for
        free available online. It’s an asexual reproducing knowledge
        system. I can learn online how to help evolve the online
        system.</p>
        <p>I know not everybody can become a webdeveloper, systemadmin
        or hardware crack. But the least you can do is trying to
        understand that information online can’t be owned, neither
        public nor private. We have the technology and the information
        to produce an internet, that is autonomous and decentralized. An
        Internet of things which all contribute to the global network of
        information. My kindle can be a webserver and so can your
        fridge. For that we have to get rid of the notion that the
        Internet has to there for us 24/7. That is an artifact of modern
        service design and not our own doing. What is more comfortable
        and cheaper for a financial corporation then having an office,
        open from 8 to 5? An online website where customers can do their
        business 24/7 and on the weekend.</p>
        <p>I will go overboard now and end this article by saying that
        the Internet might be a living thing, our baby, which we have to
        care for, growing it in our own image.</p>
