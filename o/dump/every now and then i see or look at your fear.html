        misogyny, your stupid actions, stupid ideas and stupid believes.
        and then i become stupid, become fearful and become full of
        hatred. the endless train of thought, what do i have to do
        against it, how am i part of the problem, how can i change it,
        change myself, prevent it. but then again, i choose to
        concentrate on what i can do, what i love and what creates
        robust diversity and beauty.</p>
