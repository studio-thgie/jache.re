        Green</a> from Stefano Mancuso is an interesting book. In its
        core it makes an argument for plants as being intelligent. The
        main method to convey this point is by comparison with humans.
        Plants as nonhuman intelligence — not not-human
        intelligence.</p>

        <h2 id="brilliant-green">Brilliant Green</h2>
        <p>Scattered around the book are some interesting tidbits and
        facts — like that Switzerland ascribes dignity to plants or that
        the root tip is super sensitive sensorfilled and acts like a
        swarm together with the other few million root tips.</p>
        <p>And every time the comparison to humans comes up. There is a
        certain eagerness in the constant promoting of plants as at
        least as intelligent as humans. This is probably also the
        fundamental flaw of the book. All aspiration aside — it is not
        the time to elevate something, anything to the level of being
        human. Especially if that elevation means getting more
        rights.</p>
        <h2 id="human-law-order">Human Law &amp; Order</h2>
        <p>Our system of laws and rights are built and maintained around
        the human. “Of course!” you say. But we are in a age where some
        of us try to ascribe <a
        href="https://www.google.ch/search?q=dolphin+personhood">personhood
        to dolphins</a>. A process that should end up in dolphins having
        the same rights as humans. Other animals like octopuses or
        ravens are also elevated and of course there are the apes.</p>
        <p>Animal rights are ultimately important and a logical step and
        there are ongoing initiatives, projects and discourses about
        that subject. Ultimately animal rights are also a fail in the
        long run.</p>
        <p>Ascribing rights to animals is nothing short of colonizing
        the animal meta space and brings so many problems with it. In
        the very least we superimpose our understanding of the world
        onto the animals. And not only one species but all of them. Now
        imagine we add plants to this matter. Let us just make all
        beings equal. Let us all be reigned by the same laws. Our laws
        are made and maintained by humans. That means they are made in
        the human way and through human language.</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p><em>The problem isn’t just that machines think differently
        from people. It is that people can’t figure out why. […] “When
        systems act in ways humans would not, we can see that their
        pareidolia is different from ours.”</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Nautilus has a very good article titled <a
        href="http://nautil.us/issue/27/dark-matter/artificial-intelligence-is-already-weirdly-inhuman">Artificial
        Intelligence Is Already Weirdly Inhuman</a>. In it they describe
        how our artificial intelligence system produce weird results and
        we don’t understand why.</p>
        <p>Pareidolia is a beautiful word. It’s sisters are apophenia
        and hierophany and the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia">three together
        may have helped ancient societies organize chaos and make the
        world intelligible</a>. It’s also one of the many reasons why we
        wont to ascribe intelligence and rights to animals and plants.
        The moment we think we’re able to prove that they are more human
        than nonhuman we can’t just handle them as objects anymore.</p>
        <p>But that is wrong. Our ways of recognizing and interacting
        with the environment we’re embedded in, is not that same as
        theirs. And to superimpose our ways is bad — see colonialism. <a
        href="https://medium.com/backchannel/can-you-rape-a-robot-c5ea9d47aef8">Jerry
        Kaplan has written a book titled “Humans need not apply”</a>.
        It’s probably well worth a read just for it’s absurdity. The
        moment we think about if raping a robot is possible we do
        something wrong.</p>
        <p>We need to be able to recognize and interact with nonhuman
        intelligence with superimposing our ways as little as possible.
        Especially as long as we can’t even understand artificial
        intelligence which is made in our own image.</p>
        <h2 id="alien-phenomenology">Alien Phenomenology</h2>
        <p>Enter <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_ontology">Object
        Oriented Ontology</a>, the brainchild of some of the weirder
        philosophers. There are several currents within OOO. Ian Bogost
        <a
        href="http://bogost.com/writing/blog/what_is_objectoriented_ontolog/">delivers
        this stunning description</a>: &gt; <em>Ontology is the
        philosophical study of existence. Object-oriented ontology
        (“OOO” for short) puts </em>things* at the center of this study.
        Its proponents contend that nothing has special status, but that
        everything exists equally-plumbers, cotton, bonobos, DVD
        players, and sandstone, for example. In contemporary thought,
        things are usually taken either as the aggregation of ever
        smaller bits (scientific naturalism) or as constructions of
        human behavior and society (social relativism). OOO steers a
        path between the two, drawing attention to things at all scales
        (from atoms to alpacas, bits to blinis), and pondering their
        nature and relations with one another as much with
        ourselves.*</p>
        <p>He also wrote a book titled Alien Phenomenology <a
        href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0816678987/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0816678987&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=animistology-20&amp;linkId=FWEFHHEUGTPWKKVP">Alien
        Phenomenology, or What It’s Like to Be a Thing</a>. It is
        somehow a bit like a stoner’s metaphysical inquiry into the
        things that suround us but on a solid philosophical base.</p>
        <h2 id="nonhuman-law-order">Nonhuman Law &amp; Order</h2>
        <p>Based on our experiences in colonialism and humanism we
        should try to skip the current process of superimposing our
        human ways onto the nonhuman. What I’d like to see is an inquiry
        into law- and policy-making lead by an OOO approach. Morals
        would need to follow later, but we can’t possibly imagine how
        those would look like.</p>
        <p>We need to find nonhuman ways to recognize and interact with
        the nonhuman and this process is lead by speculative
        thinking.</p>
