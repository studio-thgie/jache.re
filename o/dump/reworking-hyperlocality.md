I’m interested in aesthetics and practices that embrace the local environmental conditions or landscapes, and transcends these to create and maintain beyond-human communities. These aesthetics and practices are often rooted in folklore or animism. An example would be the small Japanese do-it-yourself Shinto-altars that can be found hidden away in urban environments. Another would be the [Elvavrålet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvavr%C3%A5let), which is a reminiscent of the [Alpsegen](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpsegen), a pagan/christian practice of praying to the mountains at dawn.

There a few key aspects I’m interested in:

* Memory practices rooted in environment and landscape to preserve cultural and community knowledge

* Creating and maintaining multi-species communities, which include non-human actors

* Folklore beyond nationalistic or capitalistic tendencies: Animistic aesthetics and practices are often decentralised and highly fluid in their appearance and adaption, similar to anarchist thought

* Extending or translating these aesthetics and practices to include or work in the digital realm
