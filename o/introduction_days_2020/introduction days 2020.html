        <p>Who are you and what is your background?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>software development, also working this right now for
        60%</li>
        <li>ba in industrial design in basel</li>
        <li>scientific assistant at the ixdm, if lucky 30% next
        year</li>
        <li>to know me personally a bit better, ceramics and japan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is your project idea’s central design or research
        question?</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>[[20200622133817]] Research Questions</p></li>
        <li><p>[[20200907192342]] things are people too</p>
        <ul>
        <li>we usually know animism as the belief-system of indigenous
        people and communities</li>
        <li>on animism</li>
        <li>on the problem of technological consumption</li>
        <li>I want to bring these two things together and see if animism
        can actually help with the technological consumption</li>
        <li>on the involvement of design</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Wie wird unser Zugang zu technologischen Produkten und
        Prozessen durch animistische Ansätze in deren Gestaltung
        verändert? Inwieweit kann Animismus in Design einen
        nachhaltigeren Umgang zu Technologie mit sich bringen? Was sind
        mögliche positive sowohl auch negative Auswirkungen eines
        solchen Ansatzes?</p></li>
        <li><p>Can animistic views and practices be found in approaches
        in our society, even if it can no longer show any animistic
        tradition? Can animistic practices in design lead to a more
        intensive connection to technological products and processes?
        What are the effects of such a relationship?</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Research Process</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>voice assistants</p></li>
        <li><p>three pases</p></li>
        <li><p>ap1: anthropological research: participatory observations
        as well as interviews with a focus on animistic weak
        signals</p></li>
        <li><p>ap2: design research: prototyping narratives, prototypes
        with physical as well as immaterial aspects around an allready
        existing technology</p></li>
        <li><p>ap3: testing</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is the connection between your project idea and your
        education, career and life thus far?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>it’s a passion project, doesn’t make it easier</li>
        <li>i’m very entangled with technology</li>
        <li>animism follows me since about 20 years, when i was in
        tokyo, first time i ca seriously tackle the subject</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What is the societal relevance of your project?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>basically i’m tackling the wastefull aspect of technology
        consumption</li>
        <li>theoretical level, there could be some knowledge generation
        that would be interesting for design theory as well as critical
        theory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What career goal are you pursuing with your project idea?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>transition from software development to academic career</li>
        <li>through the experience i made at the ixdm as well as zhdk i
        know i want to work in such a context in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How should your supervisor support you? Who could supervise
        your project?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>two coaches - robert and laura coppens</li>
        <li>robert can in my case help a bit less with his expertise in
        design history, but is super valuable for reflection, sharpening
        as well as learning about the research process</li>
        <li>first semester x y, berlin based, didn’t have the time i
        would have needed</li>
        <li>since then laura coppens, phd candidate at the institute for
        social anthropology at the uni bern</li>
        <li>she takes a liken to my project, can help me reflect on the
        anthropological aspects as well as the research process</li>
        </ul>
