        <p>The dissertation is placed at the intersection of these three
        subjects: Digital archives, participation and infrastructures.
        All three are dear to me on their own, have a right to be worked
        on, and their own backstory.</p>
        <p>I’m generally interested in storing, working on and sharing
        knowledge and many of my personal projects went in that
        direction. Participation is something I regard as an ehtical
        imperativ. No justice without participation. I understand
        participation as something which has to actively be created over
        and over again is not simply solveable through tools.
        Infrastructures is my main mode of analysis, discourse and
        practice. I’m a tech person; I design, create, maintain, and
        evaluate digital infrastructures.</p>
        <p>I’d love to bring these together, but haven’t found a
        specific use case yet.</p>
