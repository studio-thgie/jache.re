        <p>From the perspective of actor-network-theory, trees are an
        abundant actant in all thee books we worked with. Nevertheless,
        this usage of the concept of tree was never truly reflected but
        just assumed to be given. This essay has a closer look at the
        application of the concept of tree in the stories told.</p>

        <p>s.ix This book describes the cultural processes in which
        certain kinds of predat ry business practices, on the one hand,
        and local empowerment truggles, on the other, came to
        characterize the rainforests of Indonesia. s.1 This book is not
        a history of philosophy, hut rathcr an etlmography of global
        councction. Working through global connection, tbe book is an
        exploration of ethnographic meth ds for studying the work of the
        universal. s.3 Thi s book shows how emergent cultural forms-
        inclu ding forest destruc­ tion and environm ental advocacy-ar e
        p ersi stent but unpredictable eff e cts of global encounter s
        across diff erence . T o address these challenges, this book
        develo ps a portfolio of methods to study the pr oductive
        friction of global connections.</p>
        <ol start="19" type="a">
        <li>4 Cultures arc continually co-produccd in the interactions I
        call “friction”: the awkward, unequal, unstable, and creative
        qualities of interconnection across difference. Each chapter of
        this book develops a method for lcarning about such aspects of
        contingent cn­ counters.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="lands-end-la">Land’s End (LA)</h3>
        <ol start="19" type="a">
        <li>4 The analytical framework I adopt in this book focuses on
        the specificity ofthis conjuncture: the set ofelements,
        processes, and relations that shaped people’s lives at this time
        and place, and the political challenges that arise from that
        location. My analysis draws on ethnographic research that I con­
        ducted through repeated visits over a period oftwenty years
        (1990-2009). An ethnographic approach enabled me to pay close
        attention to the perspectives of the highlanders themselves and
        follow struggles and debates as they un­ folded. Revisiting
        offered insights that are hard to glean from one-shot re­ search
        designs, whether based on surveys or ethnographic research. 11
        lt en­ abled me to track subtle shifts in everyday ways
        ofthinking and acting before they had settled into a “new
        normal” that no langer seemed strange.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My goal in writing this book is to examine closely just what
        happened in these highlands and draw out the implications for
        politics.</p>
        <ol start="19" type="a">
        <li><p>5 With this book, I would like to do some more specific,
        political work, by challenging policies that promote the
        intensification of capitalist relations as a recipe for poverty
        reduction, and social movement agendas that render people like
        Kasar invisible or unrecognizable because they fail to fit the
        “alternative-development” niche. If these disruptions are
        productive, they can help build a future in which Kasar and his
        children will have a part.</p></li>
        <li><p>17 A conjunctural approach, which attends to “history at
        one point in time” and in space, is a form ofanalysis with an
        illustrious heritage. 46 lt is consis­ tent with Marx’s rnethod,
        which examines the multiple relations that consti­ tute concrete,
        historical forms. 47 lt is central to the work ofscholars
        inspired by Marx who combine attention to processes ofcapital
        accumulation with an emphasis on ernergence, contradiction,
        contestation, agency, and struggle­ in short, the specific
        features of a conjuncture and the rnany relations that form it.
        48 We find it in the work of feminist and postcolonial scholars
        who have broadened Marx’s capital/labor framework to exarnine
        how relations be­ tween genders, generations, and social groups
        distinguished by ethnic iden­ tity or religion shape resource
        access and mechanisms of accumulation. 49 We find it in the work
        of scholars inspired by Gramsci, who explore the way in which
        power is lived and inequality is normalized at the nexus of
        force, consent, and the production of desires for particular
        ways of living. so lt is especially prominent in the work of
        geographers who build on the work of Henri Lefebvre. 5</p></li>
        <li><p>19 y account in this book builds on these understandings
        of the subject as an agent whose desires don’t stand outside a
        conjuncture but are formed within it, and are formative in
        turn.</p></li>

        <ol start="19" type="a">
        <li><p>viii Following a mushroom, this book offers such true
        stories. Unlike most scholarly books, what follows is a riot of
        short chapters. I wanted them to be like the flushes of
        rnushrooms that come up afl:er a rain: an over-the-top bounty; a
        ternptation to explore; an always too many. To know the world
        without t�em, this book sketches open-ended assemblages of
        entangled ways of life, as these coalesce in coordination across
        many kinds of temporal rhythms. My experiment in form and my
        argument follow each other.</p></li>
        <li><p>2 This book is not a critique of the dreams of mod­
        ernization and progress that offered a vision of stability in
        the twentieth century; many analysts before me have dissected
        those dreams. Instead, I address the imaginative challenge of
        living without those handrails which once made us think we knew,
        collectively, where we were going’. <em> If ’:’e open oursel�es
