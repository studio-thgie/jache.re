        infrastructure in the becoming</h1>
        <p><em>Adrian Demleitner, University of Bern, FS
        2023</em><br><strong><em>Exploring Human and More-than-Human
        Relationships</em></strong></p>
        <p>In the following I’d like to reflect on the production of my
        short film <em>Visiting</em> that I produced for the seminar on
        <em>Exploring Human and More-than-Human Relationships</em>. I
        will begin with setting the historic frame of the place where
        the piece was made, loose a few words about the practical
        aspects of production, reflect on the process, and end with an
        aspect that is dear to me: The political dimension of this
        project.</p>
        <p>The piece plays out in a small stretch of an artificial
        water-stream, that forks of from the river Suze. This river
        flows down from the Jura mountains and crosses my hometown
        Biel/Bienne in the northern part of the city. To the south of
        the city we have another river, the Aare, which exits the city’s
        adjoint lake and forms the natural border to the small village
        of Nidau. It is this river which was shaping the local geography
        for thousands of years. It’s flowing, reflowing and overflowing
        led to the formation of the local wetlands, aptly named the
        Great Moss, an area mainly consisting of Malaria-infested
        swamps. Two large-scale waterway corrections in the 19th century
        formed the basis for a new industrial area, which is called
        Seeland today. I believe this framing to be important to
        understanding the regions’ relation to water and water-related
        infrastructures.</p>
        <p>In my short piece I wanted to recreate the experiences I made
        while engaging with a specific site in my neighbourhood, which
        includes two dams along the Suze and its sidearms. One is built
        by humans, and one by beavers.</p>
        <h2 id="production">Production</h2>
        <p>Before reflecting on the piece, I want to go into its
        production. The location is very close to where I lived at the
        time of the recording. It’s a path that is used by many locals
        to get to other places in the city. Next to uncounted crossings
        on my behalf, I also visited the location six times specifically
        to produce recordings. I missed the chance to make paper-based
        notes and mappings, and relied only on my mobile phone. I
        acquired a Zoom iQ7[^1], which plugs right into my phone and
        produces good enough recordings.</p>
        <p>With this setup, I produced roughly 4GB of media material,
        which is made out of 1.5 hours of sound material and 30 minutes
        of video material. The latter is composed of mostly 20 seconds
        long still shots of situations that captured my attention.</p>
        <p>Since I walked this path many ways, it became obvious to me,
        that I wanted to build my piece around the audio-recording of a
        walk from one dam to the other. That choice gave a lot of form
        to the rest that followed. I then wanted to structure visual
        material around three or four of the main sites of the short
        walk. This decision was guided by the need to get away from
        thinking through capturing video. The practice of recording
        sound only was very influential on my understanding of
        multi-modal ethnographies and I wanted to have that as a
        starting point.</p>
        <p>For reasons of representation of my idea, which I will go
        into further down, I considered making an interactive piece
        instead of a film. That would have allowed me to stay much
        closer to what I intended and add a map as another medial
        dimension. It would have been feasible within my knowledge and
        skills, but I believe I would have taken on too much regarding
        how much time I can invest into the production. Hence, stuck to
        audio, video and video-editing.</p>
        <h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
        <p>There are many things I could reflect on, but to stay within
        my given limits I’d like to focus on the absence of the beaver,
        multi-modal practices, the aesthetics of media production and
        the transportation of knowledge in non-textual media.</p>
        <p>Having not encountered the beavers in all of my recording
        sessions certainly was disappointing at times. It even became a
        kind of running gag at our bi-weekly seminar-sessions.
        Nonetheless, did this absence help in reflecting my expectations
        towards the beavers, and their supposed naturalness. The beaver
        is not a common animal in an urban environment and knowing
        they’re present excited me. Myself, as well as some of the
        people I spoke to, sensationalized this manifestation. The
        tension that their absence created indicated how I was framing
        them. The realization of this framing made me focus rather on
        the environment and the beavers’ impact on it.</p>
        <p>This came well together with the multi-modal recording
        practice. Especially the sound-recording essentially changes my
        personal access to the chosen location. Whereas before if framed
        it mainly through pleasing video-shots, I experience it now much
        more as a fluid assemblage. Soundscapes don’t contain clear
        borders between the things that they capture. They’re built
        through gradients and layerings, enabling the listener to sense
        several sources at the same time: road and river, industrial fan
        and birds, bicycles and trees.</p>
        <p>These two aspects, the absence of the beavers and the
        multi-modal recording, led to the experience of a living
        assemblage of interspecies being. It consisted of artificial and
        industrial components, of people passing by, of flora and fauna,
        but also of impressions in my mind. An experience that changed
        with each visit, and the experience I wanted to recreate in my
        piece. With all the recordings at hand, the editing phase was
        due. Knowing the necessary software, I was able to focus on
        playing around with ideas of assembling the material.</p>
        <p>In this course, I got to know multimodal pieces as quite
        fuzzy regarding the transfer of knowledge. Especially
        sound-walks suffer clarity when no context is provided. My wish
        was simply to work on the idea of visiting multi-species
        situations through multi-modal ethnographies as an
        epistemological gesture. I wanted to transport my experience of
        feeling invited to go to this place as a way of knowing valid on
        its own. After pursuing this wish through several edit sessions,
        I found it tough to bring the rectangular aesthetics of film in
        accordance with my intentions. There is a stark contrast in a
        living multi-species assemblage and the hard edges of a
        video-frame.</p>
        <p>I attempted to play with this tension through the application
        of montage in a two-fold manner. First, I started to pile up the
        video shots onto each other to blur the lines of linear
        narration and clear-cut images. As a second intervention, I
        dispersed text in between the visuals, trying to find a balance
        of being as informative as necessary and as vague as possible.
        Through these two applications, I tried to point the viewer in
        the direction of thought and experience without guiding and
        framing too much.</p>
        <h2 id="the-political-dimension-of-this-manifestation">The
        political dimension of this manifestation</h2>
        <p>In the following I want to delve on a thought that I
        originally had in the piece, but left it out to not overload it.
        The historical dimension of the Great Moss, the politics
        surrounding the beaver family and their stay as well as the
        landscape of the location of the piece point towards capitalist
        tensions of extraction and usefulness.</p>
        <p>Beavers are not endangered any more, and their population is
        luckily growing. There are an estimated 3000 individuals living
        in Switzerland at this moment. Despite their small numbers,
        their environmental impact is large and swift, changing
        landscapes within weeks. This process is directly perceivable by
        us. Beaver dams are unlike hyperobjects. And yet still, they
        raise questions and challenges for which we are not prepared.
        The only language we find is quantifying the costs and benefits.
        Essentially, we’re unable to find common ground, let alone a
        shared vocabulary of being together.</p>
        <p>Biel/Bienne is like many other industrial and urban zones
        prone to the presence of fallows, its German equivalent Brache
        being much more encompassing and fitting. A fallow is
        characterized by a period of being unproductive. Described from
        critical politics, fallows are a temporary break in the
        capitalist death drive. They allow the things and beings present
        to rest and unfold by their own doings. Fallows are temporary
        autonomous zones, simply by being unsupervised. The legal owners
        of a fallow do not care much what happens during the
        unproductive period. When time comes, they will reset the space
        in question, remove all disturbance, and make the fallow
        productive again.</p>
        <p>The sidearm of the Suze, in which the beavers made their
        home, is such a fallow. The sidearm is completely artificial,
        and is guided by a bed of concrete, even partially flowing under
        the city. It is not that they built their dam and den there
        because parts of it were re-naturalised, but because it was
        unused, unproductive and unsupervised. The re-naturalisation was
        for aesthetical reasons, in order to increase the value of the
        newly built apartment-complex nearby, and not as a general
        invitation to the more-than-human. The beavers’ dam was
        fortified with overflow pipes to mitigate the risk of damage to
        the apartment-complex. The beavers share their small stream with
        human debris, plastic items, industrial waste, dog excrements
        and other output that we humans feel is OK to let go into an
        unsupervised water-stream.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, they came and stayed, simply because they could.
        I’d love to point to this manifestation and read it as something
        meaningful. All ugliness withstanding, more-than-human life is
        taking residency, wherever it can, proving life in capitalist
        ruins to be a possibility.</p>
