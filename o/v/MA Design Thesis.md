# MA Design Thesis
The examination lives in it's own repository at [https://codeberg.org/thgie/ma-design-thesis](https://codeberg.org/thgie/ma-design-thesis). Of special interest are probably

- [MA Thesis - Talking (to) Things](https://codeberg.org/thgie/ma-design-thesis/src/branch/master/MA%20Thesis%20-%20Talking%20%28to%29%20Things.pdf)
- [MA Presentation - Talking (to) Things](https://codeberg.org/thgie/ma-design-thesis/src/branch/master/presentation/MA%20Thesis%20-%20TTT%20Adrian%20Demleitner%20-%20Paper.pdf)

I also created a Wiki for the project, which is markdown based and lives at [https://codeberg.org/thgie/Talking-to-Things](https://codeberg.org/thgie/Talking-to-Things).
