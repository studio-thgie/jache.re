        sanglières</h1>
        <p><em>Adrian Demleitner, University of Bern, Spring Semester
        2023 <strong>Exploring Human and More-than-Human
        Relationships</strong></em></p>
        <p>The piece <em>“notes for les sanglièrs”</em> by Elsa Brès is
        a preview of things to come, literally and speculatively.
        Literally, since it contains material from a film yet to be
        released. Speculatively, because it intensely engages with
        revolutionary politics and interspecies relations.</p>
        <p>Despite being not more than short over quarter of an hour,
        the film packs a punch. True to its title it feels like a rough
        assemblage of scraps and field notes. The piece is not telling a
        clear story with a beginning and an end, but uses sound, video,
        text and interviews fragmentarily in different arrangements. It
        was premiered at transmediale 2021, and subsequently shown at
        other exhibitions.</p>
        <p>I could make out roughly five distinguishable parts in the
        film, the first being just a grey screen and the soundscape of
        somebody walking through a sparsely inhabited landscape. This
        part fades into a discussion on how the boar’s way of being can
        be interpreted towards revolutionary politics against private
        property. This first brief talk between Elsa Brès and Paul
        Guillibert, an activist and philosopher, already exemplifies the
        core message of <em>“notes for le sanglièrs”</em>.</p>
        <p>In a brief intermezzo, a map is shown, underpinned by sounds
        of radio static. The blue map is overlaid by a visualization,
        indicating a suitability index. A voiceover and another recorded
        discussion explain how the map came into being and what it
        signifies. The map is presented as the product of quantitative
        methodologies that attempt to simulate the behaviour of boars.
        The term boarcentrism leads into the next scene.</p>
        <p>The third and longest part is composed of photos as well as
        video-material from night vision gear. The scenery shows what
        one might have imagined in the beginning. Sparsely inhabited
        landscapes, on the edge of the rural. There are hints of
        unfinished buildings, street signs, fences, a tractor, and a lot
        of overgrowth – once claimed but untended pieces of nature, lost
        to scrubs. A brief gap and, finally, we’re about to see boars.
        The recording shows a singular<a href="/o/v/On notes for les sanglières.html#fn1"
        class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
        role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of boars. While the leading
        mother is passing the camera, the younger ones are hesitating,
        staggering around, not sure how to proceed. The scene ends in
        one of the boars attacking the camera.</p>
        <p>We’re now in the dark. Brès is reading a short story about
        womxn performing a ritual, painting a sign on a wall, which
        we’re also shown illustrated on the screen. Some boars stand by,
        being acquainted with the presence of these womxn.</p>
        <p>The last scene is a frantic night-vision recording of running
        through the underwood. The shaky camera, taken straight from Sam
        Raimi’s play book, filmed from the perspective of a boar and
        tinted in red references inhibiting a non-human point of view.
        Fittingly, Paul Guillibert talks about how the camera relates to
        shamanism and can be seen as a tool of translation, bringing
        content from one system of signifiers to another.</p>
        <p>I was initially hooked by the proposition of reading the
        boar’s way of being as politics against private property.
        Leaning towards anarchism, I can see the boar as a fitting
        symbol for revolutionary action, especially in terms of the
        making of borders. That said, the rest of the film remained
        illegible for me. Only in rewatching the film as well as
        researching the bits that made it up was I able to dig deeper
        into the pieces’ meaning.</p>
        <p>There were, for example, quotes dispersed all over, their
        content seemingly unrelated to what is on-screen. The credit
        role does not mention their source. Only the website will tell
        the interested viewer that they stem from Monique Wittig’s
        <em>“Les Guérillères”</em>. The book from 1969 is about the
        life, rituals and legends of an all-woman community, as well
        their armed struggle against men. It might be of importance to
        mention that boars live in matriarchal societies.</p>
        <p>The implied politics, from both points, left me wondering why
        they are not taken up on the contextualizing websites from the
        exhibition and the director.</p>
        <p>The piece’s strongest point, in my opinion, is pointing out
        the difficulties of interspecies communication and shared
        meaning making. Attempts of creating and sharing signifiers with
        the boars appear throughout the film. Elsa Brès and Paul
        Guillibert engage philosophically with the boar by acts of
        translations. The boar’s way of being is mapped onto a political
        agenda. It is the boar that produces meaning here. Being a
        trained architect, Elsa Brès uses her skills of trade to attempt
        to map into the other direction, to understand the boar through
        quantitative methodologies. The map enables speculative
        interaction with the boar, even asking it questions through
        manipulating parameters of the landscape like knobs on a
        radio.</p>
        <p>Dispersing meaning and meaning-making all over the film
        highlights how it was built up as an epistemological assemblage.
        The resulting speculations on interspecies relations, on the
        other hand, are left vague.</p>
        <p>I believe that Elsa Brès is aware of the futility of attempts
        to communicate with the boar. The almost cathartic episode, and
        the only time the boars appear, results in them destroying the
        film equipment. The boar does not understand the kinship that is
        forced upon it. It eludes appropriation through the director and
        stays true to its own politics.</p>
        <p>The piece works wonderfully as a kind of trailer, knowing it
        contains field notes from a film yet to be released. Still, it
        can be a daunting or overwhelming experience when simply side
        glanced. The highly relational and referential style is tough to
        chew on. The media-aesthetics are confusing in parts, and as a
        viewer, I was uncertain whether I should focus on sound, video
        or text. I had to critically engage with the film to get the
        most from it. Rereading and deep reading are time-consuming, but
        ultimately rewarding and thought-provoking, regarding <em>“notes
        for le sanglièrs”</em>.</p>
        <p>Lastly, to use a concept of Elizabeth Povinelli, what does
        the boar think of this manifestation, the forced upon kinship as
        well as the media piece? How does it make sense of being spoken
        to, speculatively, and being used as a symbol, philosophically?
        After all, the boars are absent, even when the film seemingly is
        about them. This absence, though, needs to be understood as
        agency on behalf of the boar. It is not only our inability to
        speak to it, but also its own choice to elude our attempts to do
        so.</p>
