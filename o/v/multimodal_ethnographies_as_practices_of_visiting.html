        ethnographies as practices of visiting</h1>
        <p>I first want to play the short film and then create some
        context by giving insights into production but also talk a bit
        about the idea behind all of it.</p>
        <h2 id="introcontext">Intro/Context</h2>
        <p>In my short piece I wanted to recreate the experiences I made
        while engaging with a specific site in my neighbourhood as well
        as attempt to capture the thoughts and ideas that arose in
        working through the theories and approaches of multimodal
        more-than-human anthropology.</p>
        <p>[Image of beaver dam]</p>
        <p>What first caught my attention was the occurence of a
        disturbance of the as-usual. A beaver family has made a rather
        short, but renaturalized, piece of a local waterstream their
        home. Being fascinated by contemporary beyond-human literature
        at first I over-theorized this occurance. I was excited that
        beavers build their own infrastructure, a dam not unlike a
        human-made dam, similar but different. In the process of
        multimodal research of the beaver family, their infrastructure,
        and most importantly, the site of all of this itself, my
        perception and my focus of interests shifted.</p>
        <p>In my engangement, not only with the course-material, but
        also with the popular point of view on the beaver, I had to
        realize that I too, frame the beaver through their industrial
        capabilities. I didn’t see the beavers, literaly, I saw only
        their dams.</p>
        <h2 id="specifics">Specifics</h2>
        <p>[Map of the place]</p>
        <p>I walk this short stretch of waterway quite regularly,
        sometimes several times a week. I went to produce
        fieldrecordings there six times, audio and video. I honestly
        wasn’t quite sure what I intended with the recordings. Following
        Hanna’s advice, I had a rough question in place: How do the two
        dam’s interact with each other and their respective
        environments. Those two infrastructures then became my focii in
        the initial sessions. But I didn’t feel like I’m getting
        anywhere with my process.</p>
        <p>[nice photo of traces of beaver]</p>
        <p>What was much more important for me was being present. The
        recording-sessions became exercises in observation. Especially
        the audio-recordings were influencal on my perception and
        getting to know the place. It became very clear to me, that I
        wanted to build my piece around the audio-recording of a walk
        from one dam to the other. That choice gave a lot of form to the
        rest that followed. I then wanted to structure visual material
        around three or four of the “main” sites of the short walk.</p>
        <p>[Map of the place; with main sites circled]</p>
        <p>The problem is a bit that I have much more impressions in my
        head than on camera or my audiorecorded, material that I
        couldn’t express. I’m also not sure if more recordings would
        solve that problem. The application of collage is an attempt to
        deal with the semi-structured material I have in me. Flashes of
        views and sounds, layered on top of each other, weaved into
        situations.</p>
        <p>I also took Michaela’s advice to heart and tried to build
        little dams into my Premiere timeline ;)</p>

        <h2 id="beavers-and-visiting-as-a-gesture">Beavers and visiting
        as a gesture</h2>
        <p>Beavers not endangered anymore, and their population is
        luckily growing. There are an estimated 3000 individuals living
        in Switzerland at this moment. Despite their small numbers,
        their environmental impact is large and swift, changing
        landscapes within weeks. This process is directly perceivable by
        us. Beaver dams are unlike hyperobjects. And yet still, they
        raise questions and challenges for which we are not prepared.
        The only language we find is quantifying the costs and
        benefits.</p>
        <p>[Image of algae with Statistics Emoji overlayed]</p>
        <p>I felt the need to find gentler ways of framing our
        relationship with the more-than-human. I wanted to avoid seeing
        the beavers through statistical measures or their seemingly
        industrial practices. Instead, I wanted to take the beavers dam
        as an invitation to visit a complex multi-species situation. I
        guess one of the hallmarks of the anthropocene is, that we
        humans stopped being guests on this planet. We’ve became the
        main hosts, and honestly, we’re terrible at it.</p>
        <p>[Complete quote; read it aloud]</p>
        <p>And this is pretty much the moment when I remembered a
        favourite of mine. Donna Haraway, in describing Vinciane
        Despret’s practice in Staying with the Trouble, uses Hanna
        Arendts words to talk of the arts of visiting. She also talks of
        how one needs to be genuinly curious in order to properly visit.
        I found that fitting. Not necessarily as an outcome, but as an
        approach to inquire this site I chose. Maybe also as an approach
        to practice being a guest? At least I wanted to somehow express
        that in my piece.</p>
        <p>[Another nice photo of the walk]</p>
        <h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
        <p>In the comming few weeks I plan to work on the quality of the
        piece. Maybe some of the shots can be improved by color-grading.
        I also plan to produce some more recordings, video and audio.
        I’d love to capture some life and interactions and weave that
        into the piece.</p>
        <p>In this course I got to know multimodal pieces as quite fuzzy
        regarding the transfer of knowledge. Especially soundwalks
        suffer clarity when no context is provided. My wish was simply
        to work on the idea of visiting multi-species situations through
        multi-modal ethnographies as a epistemological gesture. I’d love
        to hear from you, where and how the piece could be improved in
        order to advance this idea.</p>
