        <h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>
        <p>I studied postindustrial design at Hyperwerk Basel and right
        now I‚Äôm doing a master in design research at MAD until 2022,
        focusing on technology and animism. Currently, I‚Äôm working as
        senior webdeveloper in Bern and until recently also as junior
        researcher at the Institute of Experimental Design and Media
        Cultures in Basel, Switzerland.</p>
        <p>My interests lay in the fields of critical thought on
        software and technology, design research, intersectional issues
        and the non- and more-than-human discourses. I‚Äôm active in these
        fields of inquiry through curatorial and artistic practices,
        design research as well as events focusing on knowledge transfer
        and participation.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm somewhat entangled in the DYI, hacking, queer and art
        scenes and I have a sensuous interest in the multispecies
        discourse. These struggles and poetics inform what I do, who I
        feel I am and where I feel home. It‚Äôs a mess, but a beautiful
        one.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I‚Äôm a üêù beekeeper (Warr√©), love to engage the
        world through üç≤ cooking and have a good hand with üå±
        plants.</p>

        <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
        <pre><code>&quot;Animism had endowed things with souls; industrialism makes souls into things.&quot; - Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno</code></pre>
        <p>The text circles around notions of care for the material and
        more specifically for the objects that we surround ourselves
        with. Ontological design derives from Heidegger how we not only
        design objects, but also how these objects design our
        ontologies. Consumer electronics became steady companions in our
        life. Not only do we interact with them on a regular base, they
        also accompany us throughout the day. We could call them
        companion objects, following Donna Haraway‚Äôs concept of
        companion species ‚Äî electronics and people, who are bonded in
        significant otherness.</p>
        <p>These electronic objects are highly designed and branded
        experiences, to be consumed and discarded. They gift us a
        membership of specific cultural demographics. They‚Äôre not made
        to last, unlike you would expect from an expensive kitchen knife
        or a pair of good shoes. Their frictionless design makes them
        easily replaceable, which also expresses itself in the sheer
        unrepairability. Following this lines of thought, design
        practices disable not only the care for the object, but also our
        understanding of the importance to care for the material.</p>
        <p>Consumer electronics become mediators of ontological
        affordances.</p>
        <p>Repair practices break this dependence on exploitative
        entities. They root us firmly back into the material.
        Alternative ways of caring for companion objects are also found
        in shintoistic practice. This is exemplified by Hari-Kuy≈ç, a
        burial festival for broken-needles, in which these are honored
        for their services and then recycled. Animistic epistemologies
        enable us to level the ontological field and create social ties
        to objects. These epistemologies then enable different ways to
        care and respect the material. In the light of the environmental
        impact of electronics, cared for and long-living companion
        objects seem to be a desirable alternative.</p>
        <p><strong>Length</strong>: 20 minutes for my presentation with
        10 minutes for Q+A (I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Q+As, but always
        glad to have some participatory action going on)</p>
