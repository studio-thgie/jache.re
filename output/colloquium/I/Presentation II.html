        <p>Hello everybody and thank you very much for being present at
        my short presentation on my research project. In the provided
        paper i focused mainly on the construction and justification of
        the the research question as well as the relevance. In this
        presentation I’ll go into the details of three areas I could
        only briefly touch so far: Animism, narratives and the research
        setup.</p>
        <p>I want to start where the paper ended. Let me give you some
        context.</p>
        <p>[Slide with Aibo image from presentation]</p>
        <p>In the Shinto-Buddhistic beliefs of Japan, everything has
        soul or spirit. These are not uniquely human, but to be human
        can be one of the stations on the soul’s path. Like this, the
        concept of soul can act as a unifier along difference. As you
        can see, these Aibo robots also have soul and they are treated
        accordingly. The support and maintenance of Aibo bots was
        stopped in 2014, which left many of the owners desperate. They
        did not only find entertainment in these gadgets, but
        companions. As a response to the pressure of the owners of these
        bots, Sony came up with a workaround. What you see in this
        picture is a funeral-service hold for Aibos at Kofukuji, an old
        temple near Tokyo. Sony, the temple and a company called <em>A
        Fun</em> work together in a recycling scheme. Completely defunct
        Aibos are given their final blessing and then become
        cannibalised for parts to repair less seriously damaged
        models.</p>
        <p>This is a story about animism, but it is not our story.</p>
        <p>[Slide Image Descartes/Livestock]</p>
        <p>Where im from, we also have a concept of soul, which became
        superseded by rationality and humanistic values during the
        enlightenment. But it seems like, that our concept of soul is
        much more about a differentiation from the rest of the world
        then a connection. Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy
        had an opinion about animals. He denied them reason,
        intelligence, let alone a soul. As such, he said, they are like
        machines and feel neither pain nor anxiety. I’m speculating
        here, but there might be some connection to this view on animals
        and the ethics of industrial livestock farming.</p>
        <p>This is not a story about animism, but it is our story.</p>
        <p>We tend to discredit stories, or narratives, as fiction but
        then again, they accompany us since childhood and are the
        driving power behind advertisement, on of the strongest
        industries as of today.</p>
        <p>[Slide with quote]</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“It matters what matters we use to think other matters with;
        <strong>it matters what stories we tell to tell other stories
        with;</strong> it matters what knots knot knots, what thoughts
        think thoughts, what descriptions describe descriptions, what
        ties tie ties. It matters what stories make worlds, what worlds
        make stories.” - Donna J. Haraway, Staying with the Trouble</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is probably one of the more often quoted pieces of Donna
        Haraway’s latest book, Staying with the Trouble. She wants to
        point out, how important a reflection on the assumed basics are
        and how we’re embodying them ourselves. It’s a poetic rendition
        of what Anne-Marie Willis writes about in her work on
        ontological design.</p>
        <p>[Slide with quote]</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“If we pervade buildings, they also pervade us — entrances,
        corridors, stairs, lifts, large rooms, small rooms — all design
        our modes of spatial occupation and our movements through
        spaces, allowing some, not allowing others. <strong>While we as
        humans design buildings, they also design us.</strong>” -
        Anne-Marie Willis, Ontological Designing</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It matters what designs design designs. Narratives are
        designs for the ontological. Narratives shape our
        Being-in-the-world, as much as a door in a room, just not on a
        physical plane, but how we understand the world and how we
        behave towards it.</p>
        <p>[Slide: Animism]</p>
        <p>Let us have a look at the project-specific application of the
        term animism before I go deeper into the proposed research
        approach.</p>
        <p>Being me, a privileged white person, and speaking of animism
        is not without problems. Animism is an anthropological term,
        coined in colonial times by a christian-raised man. And that’s
        what it is. When I speak about animism I can only speak about an
        anthropological categorization, and never about indigenous
        communities and peoples specific animistic practices of
        world-making and beliefs.</p>
        <p>The research project is based on the assumption that animism
        is not only culturally conditioned, but is a basic constant of
        human existence. However, the majority of Western cultures have
        lost an animistic practice. An appropriation of animistic
        narratives, and thus identity and faith culture, of indigenous
        communities is not only ethically wrong, but also
        counter-productive. An animism is embedded and interwoven in a
        multitude of practices and specific epistemologies. It is
        therefore necessary to develop animistic narratives that can
        take root here <em>in the West</em>.</p>
        <p>[Slide: Shintoism]</p>
        <p>That said, there is one specific animism, which served as
        inspiration for this projects approach.</p>
        <p>Shintoism is one of Japan’s official religion and is
        categorized as animism. Basically, in it all kind of things can
        have a spirit residing in them; From rivers, mountains and the
        sun to foxes, trees and also all kind of human made objects.
        What is interesting is, that Shintoism is a decentralised and
        highly hyperlocalised belief- and practice-system. Every
        community has their own spirits to interact with and do so in
        ways appropriate to the local environment. It is said that there
        are 8 million different spirits, which in Shintoism is
        synonymous with infinite. An animism is seemingly messy because
        it gives agency to the other whereas western epistemologies
        usually search for order in hierarchies.</p>
        <p>[Slide with image of lantern tsukumogami]</p>
        <p>The relationship the japanese people have with their things
        goes a long way. There is a category of spirits called the
        tsukumogami, that is objects that aquired spirit. The word is
        generally understood as an object that has reached it’s 100th
        birthday. I’d say we know similar stories of old things, that
        are haunted, in good and in bad ways. It shows how heirloom
        object can be loaded up through history and find poetic
        expression in animism.</p>
        <p>[Slide with Image Hari-Kuyo]</p>
        <p>Another beautiful example and related to the Aibo case is
        Hari-Kuyō, the shintoistic festival for the broken needles.
        You’ve seen this image in the paper. As all things can have
        spirit in Shintoism, so do needles. If a needle is broken or
        becomes unusable, one has to tend to that spirit attached. If
        not properly respected, that spirit can start to haunt the
        owner. So these needles are brought to a temple and honored for
        their work. Further, the needles collected in this manner are
        then recyled by the temple, melted and used as raw material for
        new things.</p>
        <p>The adaptability of Shintoism, it’s nonrigid structures and
        it’s hyperlocal practices let it transition into the industrial
        Japan and by today, finds it’s applications in modern
        technology. A kind of Shintoistic Techno-Animism. That’s what I
        wanted to point out with the Aibo robots example. There is a
        connection, between these narratives around the spirits and the
        practices of recycling and this connection has made it into
        these, modern times. Techno-animism is of interest to the
        project because it can serve as an example of possibility.</p>
        <p>There are three core aspects of animism that are of
        importance here.</p>
        <p>[Slide with circle Graphic]</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>Animism as relational epistemology</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This aspect is taken up from recent movements in philosophy
        and anthropology. It is the theoretical base-layer that aides
        and guides this project. It is maybe also the most difficult
        part to explain. The connection between animism and a relational
        epistemology is made already in Nurit Bird-David’s paper
        “Animism revisited” which was published 1999.</p>
        <p>[Slide with quote]</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“<strong>This epistemology is about knowing the world by
        focusing primarily on relatednesses</strong>, from a related
        point of view, within the shifting horizons of the related
        viewer. The knowing grows from and is the knower’s skills of
        maintaining relatedness with the known.” - Nurit Bird-David,
        Animism Revisited</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is in stark contrast to our specific way of knowing the
        world, including ourselves, where the focus is on how something
        is constituted or how can I use something - where we quickly
        have a dichotomy between subject and object.</p>
        <p>In western thought we have this idea that to be human is to
        be a body and a mind and in many cases also a soul and that this
        configuration is only possible in humans. In animist thought
        subjectivity, the experience of I, arises out of social ties to
        other people. In this web of relationships plants and animals as
        well as inanimate matter and objects can be people as well and
        as such be open for social relations. It helps to imagine an
        object like a pet, in which we can find a companion, but whose
        language we can’t understand.</p>
        <p>[Slide with circle graphic again]</p>
        <ol start="2" type="1">
        <li>The Aesthetics of animism</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The aesthetics of animism are like the affordances of
        narratives, or the packaging of the animistic narratives. While
        the core point, relational epistemology, is share by many
        animisms, the aesthetics can differ quite a lot.</p>
        <p>The aesthetics can be the choice of tone in language, the
        form given to an object, or the selection of patterns that
        create relatability or what shape a spirit has taken. Aesthetics
        from aisthesis, perception, is the form via which the people can
        engage with the narrative. This relates to the adaptability of
        animism as mentioned above, in the quote on the 8 million
        spirits in shintoism. Animism is about making a relation fitting
        the local context. As animism is always making embodied, local
        connections, it is important to develop a framework for
        narratives of generating aesthetics that fit a local
        context.</p>
        <p>This aspect of animism is where design practice and design
        research come in. The creation of affordances on all planes of
        experience is where design is strong, be it visual, as written
        story or a physical object.</p>
        <ol start="3" type="1">
        <li>The entangled practices</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Narratives are not just oral stories to be told. narratives
        are also embodied and material practices. Sometimes they come
        out of stories, and sometimes the stories come out of them.
        Rituals come to mind, but even oral storytelling practice is
        embodied in a shared, secure and trusting space. An animistic
        narrative can’t be simply written on a paper and read to a
        participant and it works. It needs to be physical embodied into
        practices, rituals, repetitions, places and shared with
        people.</p>
        <p>These three core aspects make up the narratives that this
        projects wants to develop, whereas the first aspect is more or
        less a given. Animism lends itself to design through it’s poetic
        powers and the ability to evoke emotion.</p>
        <p>I want to start with a small example to link this analysis
        with the proposed research process.</p>
        <p>[Slide]</p>
        <p>Many of us speak with plants, me included. Many of us also
        heard about the research done into the benefits of speaking with
        plants. And probably everybody who heard about that research
        never cared to actually read it. It is hard to say what came
        first, the practice of speaking with plants or the reasearch
        into the benefits, but i doubt that it’s the later. This
        practice is also often embedded into the weekly routine of
        watering the plants where we have the embodied practices.</p>
        <p>The research process is parted into three phases.</p>
        <p>[Slide with 3-phase process]</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Inputs → Weak Signals</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the given example, speaking with plants would be a weak
        signal. Weak signals are something that are already present,
        hiding amid the noise of daily life. I’m interested in weak
        signals that can be amplified into animistic narratives. These
        can be found in the daily routines and stories already
        present.</p>
        <p>The discovery of these rely on classic ethnographic research:
        observation, interviews as well as the attempt to extrapolate
        from good parts of technology through appreciative inquiry.</p>
        <p>The collected weak signals are categorized and will be made
        ready for the second phase.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Design → Fictions, Fabulations, Futures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Relating to the example, this is the circulating story about
        the research into the benefits. This phase is about the
        development or design of narratives. As mentioned above, this
        will include ephemeral as well as physical components. I want to
        organize two different workshop formats, in which designers as
        well as users take part.</p>
        <p>The Make Tools workshop will concentrate on the physical
        aspects and the Design Fiction on the part that can be written
        down as a story. Both formats will draw heavily on methods used
        in speculative design, but without a speculative work as it’s
        main output. Needless to say that the two formats will have to
        work together so that the results of the one inspire the process
        of the other.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Testing → Cultural Probe</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The last and most important phase is also the phase I’m most
        unsure about, and as such would love to have some feedback from
        you later on. Basically I’m interested in the change of
        worldview as well as behavior that can be triggered through this
        narratives.</p>
        <p>I planned to do A-B-A and longitude tests. In these a
        baseline is established in a first interview or observation of a
        person. The narratives are then given as cultural probes to the
        volunteers. In A-B-A there is testing during the engagement with
        the cultural probe as well as when the probe isn’t present
        anymore, to see a deviation to the baseline. In longitude tests,
        the same variables are observed over a period of time. It’s more
        difficult to get a whole picture with this method, but good to
        observe details.</p>
        <p>[Same Slide with 3-phase process but with descriptions
        added]</p>
        <p>I want to give a short fictional example to illustrate the
        process.</p>
        <p>Weak Signal: A participants is observed to wipe down the
        smartphone with a wet wipe upon arrival at home. Later
        questioned, the person explains the practice with a removal from
        the microbes and how beautiful shiny the smartphone is
        after.</p>
        <p>Design: The participatory workshops comes up with a package,
        consisting of a small pedestal for the smartphone that also add
        a nice light, as well as a short story centering on the positive
        feelings a smartphone has after being cleaned.</p>
        <p>Testing: A volunteer is given the package as cultural probe,
        with a set of tasks and a diary for self-observation. The
        volunteer will do an A-B-A testing to see if the baseline
        behaviour changed after the cultural probe package is given
        back. All overall a slightly reduced screen time at home is
        measured. especially during the B-Phase, but no substanial
        change in buying behavior is found in a longitude test.</p>
        <p>I hope this example could illustrate the proposed
        research-process a bit. The projects attempts to find narratives
        for already existing technological products and processes that
        influence our everyday life, like smartphones or social media
        feeds. In this, it does not seek to propose a best outcome in
        results. For example, it does not propose an optimal screentime,
        as such a variable is highly individual. There are some outcomes
        which can be deemed positive, and those are the reduction in
        consumption of new devices and energy as these are directly
        related to the exploitation of a workforce in precar situation
        as well as the negative impact for the ecosystem.</p>
        <p>[Slide with fechner]</p>
        <p>I want to finish this presentation with a small anecdote. Do
        you remember my example about speaking to plants? I wanted to
        see mentioned research myself and have at least a look at it.
        There is actually not much decisive research on the benefits of
        speaking to plants and what is out there is often heavily
        contested. But the actual idea or theory that plants benefit
        from human conversation dates back to 1848, when German
        professor Gustav Fechner published the book <em>Nanna or About
        The Inner Life Of Plants</em>.</p>
        <p>[Slide with Fechners Nanna Book]</p>
        <p>You see, Fechner was an advocate of a type of panpsychism and
        he argued that plants are conscious beings, having a life of
        feeling and volition, and thus should be treated like
        people.</p>
        <p>That is a story about animism, and it is our story.</p>
