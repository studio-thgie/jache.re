        <p>Q&amp;A Board<br />
        q: How does use of voice assistants for people with
        seh-/mobilitätsbeinträchtigung differ?<br />
        a: Both can profit …</p>
        <p>q: UX perspective, user experience to human experience, how
        about people affected by …? More down to earth approach …<br />
        a: Yes</p>
        <p>q: Presented outlook, how high is chance that you’ll have a
        little bit done, MVP?<br />
        a: Very very small; biggest problem is finding, agreeing with
        participants; followup interview, but no workshop, no MVP</p>
        <p>q: Shift from voice assistant to … also shifts stakeholders,
        foundations, society, commercial companies; agencies might
        differ; project could profit from having different
        stakeholders<br />
        a: OK</p>
        <p>q: Shift, should take it seriously; still lot of focus on
        tech, not needs of person; fascination with topic itself;
        leftover from privacy discussion; take new focus to whole
        project; read/include discourse; lacking from the presentation;
        lack of knowledge in draft<br />
        a: OK, won’t start before 2025, engaged as scientific software
        dev for SNF project until then? =&gt; Would check if SNF forbids
        starting with PhD; do ground work, publications in smaller
        portions; start with 2-3 publications, will help with SNF,
        establishing collaboraitions, etc.; secretly start with PhD
        =&gt; Crucial do make it less vague; we expect you to plan PhD
        now</p>
        <p>q: Budget, timeline should be more detailed<br />
        a: OK</p>
        <p>Q&amp;A Peers<br />
        q: Remark, people with disabilities, explore digitality and
        effects on these people; how these devices are related to<br />
        a: Thanks</p>
        <p>Adrian<br />
        q: Missing something in terms of methodologies?<br />
        a: Case studies, interviews, dn’t miss anything; Define reserch
        question that leads to design research; Not the time right now,
        but sketch main methods you’d like to look at; give us an idea
        about research questions, methods you’d like to use; realise
        that there are different mindsets state of the art, case study
        and gaining knowledge, … =&gt; Currently rather unclear what you
        expect from which method; how many interviews, what kind of
        people, this is too vague; Idea: take disabilities seriously,
        start including them in planning of workshop =&gt; NZZ Format
        documentary about peer recovery, … =&gt; software devs, … think
        inclusion radical =&gt; … Ham [?], psychiatric experiences,
        methodological framework, … =&gt; Define more detailed map of
        methods, presented potential partners, maybe now time to
        approach them, try to plan a setup, know participants, redefine
        methods</p>
