        with our technology.</p>
        <p>Our bodies were never just a single thing. They are basically
        modular systems and we are just beginning to understand, how to
        hook technology into it.</p>
        <p>On the other side of the spectrum we have some interesting
        developments in the bacterial universe. Not only can they
        replace all body cleansing products, they can also be used as
        body computers.</p>

        <p><em>Now, however, advances in artificial intelligence,
        cybernetics, and genomics are blurring the outlines of the
        once-cozy categories of human, animal, and machine. Under the
        loose and shifting rubrics of “transhumanism” and
        “posthumanism,” a growing number of artists, philosophers, and
        self-modifying “biohackers” are looking to redefine the
        boundaries of the self.</em></p>
