        <ul>
        <li>literacy is necessary for a functioning society in the
        modern age. * literacy is not * education. A person educated in
        * can understand *. A* literate person can do *.* literacy
        empowers everyone who possesses it to be active contributors to
        their own life and society as whole.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The * literacy suffers from a monoculture, and it is
        diversity that *ists seek to achieve. We assert that the right
        of freedom of inquiry, to do* research and pursue understanding
        under oneâ€™s own direction, is a fundamental right.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>research requires tools. We the *ists are dedicated to
        putting the tools of* investigation into the hands of anyone who
        wants them. We are building an infrastructure of methodology, of
        communication and of publicly available knowledge. As *ists it
        is our responsibility to act as emissaries of* , creating new
        *ists out of everyone we meet. We communicate not only the value
        of our research, but the value of our methodology and
        motivation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>*ists take responsibility for their research. We keep in mind
        that our subjects of interest are dynamic systems worthy of
        respect and good treatment, and we are acutely aware that our
        research affects those around us.* ists engage in their *
        research with a critical mind, astonishment and a pinch of
        humour.</p>
        <p>The *ists are actively engaged in making the world a place
        that everyone can understand. Come, let us research
        together.</p>
