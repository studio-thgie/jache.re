# Thinking through AI

Iâ€™m not really interested into AI, or more precisely advanced electronic pattern recognition. But what I really like about it is, how it enables us to think about intelligence in connection to humans, bodies and non-humans. Algorithms will not take over the world. Entities with raw computing power, databases filled with personas and proprietary AI are already on the job.
