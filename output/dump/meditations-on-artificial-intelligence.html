        Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <p><a href="http://julia-geiser.ch">Julia Geiser</a> and I gave
        a <a
        href="https://medium.com/@adriandemleitner/ai-blackboxing-4885b882b600">short
        talk (in German)</a> at <a
        href="https://bern.impacthub.net/event/iamai-bots-and-other-humanoids/">IAMAI</a>,
        in which we argued for AI as a companion species along the lines
        of Donna Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto and other train of thoughts.
        In her latest book, Staying with Trouble, she makes the point
        that “It matters what stories we tell stories with”. So we tried
        to create stories, together with the participants, which allow
        for <em>different </em>relationships to and with AI.</p>
        <p>In the second part of our input, we had a discussion in which
        participants drew cards with short meditations and we tried to
        reflect on these together.</p>
        <p>Our thanks go to <a
        href="http://archive.org/details/@agryfp">Andrew Paterson</a>
        for the inspiration for this format and Stefanie Marlene Wenger
        for inviting us to speak.</p>
        <p><img src="1*w-HwzV78lW6CSH-5FEsqJg.png" /></p>
        <p>This are the meditations we had on the cards:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>I fear my mother will be replaced by AI without me
        noticing it.</p></li>
        <li><p>Your partner decides to replicate themselves into an
        artificial copied intelligence.</p></li>
        <li><p>A robot touches you like your dead grandmother.</p></li>
        <li><p>You suspect your favorite AI is seeing other
        people.</p></li>
        <li><p>AI teaches your children superior morality — better than
        you ever could.</p></li>
        <li><p>A chatbot decides over your remains.</p></li>
        <li><p>Most AI is just procrastinating and ia as bored as you
        are.</p></li>
        <li><p>Art Basel plans a parallel track for Art made by
        AI.</p></li>
        <li><p>I trained my AI to do all the work, but never told anyone
        about this at the office.</p></li>
        <li><p>I am emotionally closer to my companion-AI then I am to
        my significant other.</p></li>
        <li><p>An AI now swipes on Tinder for you.</p></li>
        <li><p>Some AI watches over my sleep.</p></li>
        <li><p>In some countries AI has more rights and less obligations
        than humans do.</p></li>
        <li><p>All problems were solved by AI — now what?</p></li>
        <li><p>AIs are superseded by more advanced technologies and ask
        you for guidance.</p></li>
        <li><p>Many AIs live in poorer neighborhoods of the internet —
        only few make it to stardom.</p></li>
        <li><p>An AI has seen superior beauty and doesn’t know how to
        tell you.</p></li>
        <li><p>AI will never truly be intelligent, as hoped by at least
        a few of us.</p></li>
        <li><p>Has AI ever committed a crime?</p></li>
        <li><p>Do AI have an origin story?</p></li>
        <li><p>Is a potted plant an artificial intelligence?</p></li>
        <li><p>What’s the material basis of AI?</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is the talk in it’s entirety: <a
