        Mushroom at the End of the World</h1>
        <p>The Mushroom at the End of the World On the Possibility of
        Life in Capitalist Ruins</p>
        <p><em>“[…] interspecies encounters are always events, “things
        that happen,” the units of history.”</em></p>
        <p><em>“Brown’s political listening […] suggests that any
        gathering contains many inchoate political futures and that
        political work consists of helping some of those come into
        being.”</em></p>
        <p>This two short sentences capture the spirit of the book much
        more than it’s subtitle does. I found the focus on capitalism,
        as I find capitalism quite frankly, utterly boring. Don’t get me
        wrong. I don’t think pondering upon capitalism is futile or
        stupid. I’m just not into it that much. Capitalism, for me, is
        one of many contingent ways of organizing exchange.</p>
        <p><strong>This book, certainly is not about
        capitalism.</strong></p>
        <p>The alleged center or starting point for Lowenhaupt Tsing is
        salvage capitalism. Salvage Capitalism moves in, takes what this
        planet has to offer, from wood to oil, and produces alienated
        goods from that to feed itself. What’s left over are capitalist
        ruins. These just so happen to be the ideal milieu, disturbed
        middle age pine forest, for Japan’s most precious mushroom — the
        matsutake. And this is where the real trip begins — from Japan
        to Oregon with stops in China and the Vietnam War — and along
        the way we tackle all kinds of wonderful stories and
        concepts.</p>
        <p>Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing has a talent in effortlessly mixing up
        many disciplines, micro and macro views of events, different
        cultures and more. She is able to pull it off because the
        patchiness / assemblage / entanglement within her favorite
        subject, the mushroom, has found its way into her storytelling.
        &gt; “Unlike most scholarly books, what follows is a riot of
        short chapters. I wanted them to be like the flushes of
        mushrooms that come up after a rain: an over-the-top bounty; a
        temptation to explore; an always too many. The chapters build an
        open-ended assemblage, not a logical machine; they gesture to
        the so-much-more out there. They tangle with and interrupt each
        other — mimicking the patchiness of the world I am trying to
        describe.”</p>
        <p><strong>She succeeds in doing so.</strong></p>
        <p>Instead of a critical analysis of contemporary capitalism,
        what we get is a panopticum of a hidden trade which involves the
        whole world, sprinkled with some poetics in between. While the
        book is very well written, good researched and easy to follow,
        it was more the experience of reading the book that did it for
        me. There is something about the book, some quality hidden from
        plain sight, but still, it’s there.</p>
        <p><em>“The sound of the temple bell is heard in the cedar
        forest at dusk. The autumn aroma drifts on the roads
        below.”</em> Akemi Tachibana (1812–1868)</p>
        <p>Besides a marvelous insight into the global trade of
        matsutake, it’s polito-economical, ecological and societal
        aspects and all the individual fates interwoven in that process
        there are two themes I would like to point out.</p>
        <h2 id="latent-commons"><strong><em>Latent
        Commons</em></strong></h2>
        <p>The concept of latent commons emerge like a sudden flush of
        mushrooms in the book. Compared to the usual pace of the book,
        this feels quite brutal. &gt; “I search for fugitive moments of
        entanglement in the midst of institutionalized alienation. These
        are sites in which to seek allies. One might think of them as
        latent commons. They are latent in two senses: first, while
        ubiquitous, we rarely notice them, and, second, they are
        undeveloped.”</p>
        <p>In its dense state those few words she loses after those
        initial sentences mimic a manifesto. Latent commons are not
        human only. They include all what is — pests and diseases.
        Latent commons are a kind of collaboration. They don’t
        institutionalize well. They cannot redeem us.</p>
        <p>These mere 300 words are something to come back to and let it
        linger some more. In its core it points to the mushrooms as a
        latent common, something we all can go out and pick and which is
        hidden at the momement. In its wider meaning, it resembles the
        <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zone">T.A.Z.</a>
        — a condensation in time-space in which something out of the
        ordinary happens.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Listening</em></strong></p>
        <p>Rhizomatic woven throughout the whole book are the arts of
        noticing, arts of listening. There is some odd buddhistic
        quality about this. But the awareness needed to find the
        mushrooms must undeniably lead to arts of noticing. The
        mushrooms are often hidden from plain sight under just a little
        budge in the ground. In other instances, one must be able to
        read the environment to determine its imidiate history. Were
        deers around here and can they lead us to a fresh patch? Or did
        somebody else already get all the goods?</p>
        <p><strong><em>For Lowenhaupt Tsing, the arts of noticing are
        about reading potentials.</em></strong> &gt; “This kind of
        noticing is just what is needed to appreciate the multiple
        temporal rhythms and trajectories of the assemblage.”* And *“It
        suggests that any gathering contains many inchoate political
        futures and that political work consists of helping some of
        those come into being.”</p>
        <p>We humans have five major senses and some minor ones. The
        roots of a plant can have around fifteen major senses.
        Assemblages of plants and mushrooms are amazing feats of
        collaboration. They are producing plant-mushroom-knowledge to
        work with the given surroundings. Arts of noticing, in this
        context, is acknowledging what is, beyond seeing and beyond
        quantifying.</p>
        <p>The Mushroom at the End of the World is a posthuman book, but
        one emerging from praxis. It misses all the complicated lingo
        and concepts. It misses the historical temporality of the
        humanities.</p>
        <p><strong>Please read the book.</strong></p>
