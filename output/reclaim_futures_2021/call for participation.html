        <h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>
        <p>I studied postindustrial design at Hyperwerk Basel and right
        now I‚Äôm doing a master in design research at MAD until 2022,
        focusing on technology and animism. Currently, I‚Äôm working as
        senior webdeveloper in Bern and until recently also as junior
        researcher at the Institute of Experimental Design and Media
        Cultures in Basel, Switzerland.</p>
        <p>My interests lay in the fields of critical thought on
        software and technology, design research, intersectional issues
        and the non- and more-than-human discourses. I‚Äôm active in these
        fields of inquiry through curatorial and artistic practices,
        design research as well as events focusing on knowledge transfer
        and participation.</p>
        <p>I‚Äôm somewhat entangled in the DYI, hacking, queer and art
        scenes and I have a sensuous interest in the multispecies
        discourse. These struggles and poetics inform what I do, who I
        feel I am and where I feel home. It‚Äôs a mess, but a beautiful
        one.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, I‚Äôm a üêù beekeeper (Warr√©), love to engage the
        world through üç≤ cooking and have a good hand with üå±
        plants.</p>

        <h3 id="title">Title</h3>
        <p><strong>Things are people too</strong></p>
        <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
        <p>‚ÄúAnimism had endowed things with souls; industrialism makes
        souls into things.‚Äù - Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno</p>
        <p>The talk circles around notions of care for the non-human and
        more specifically for the technologies that we surround
        ourselves with. Anne-Marie Willis‚Äô ontological design describes
        how we not only design objects, but also how these objects
        design our ontologies. Consumer electronics and algorithms
        became steady companions in our life. Not only do we interact
        with them on a regular base, they also accompany us throughout
        the day. We could call them companion technologies, following
        Donna Haraway‚Äôs concept of companion species ‚Äî digital
        technologies and people, who are bonded in significant
        otherness.</p>
        <p>These technological products and processes are highly
        designed and branded experiences, to be consumed and discarded.
        They gift us a membership of specific cultural demographics.
        They‚Äôre not made to last, unlike you would expect from a good
        pair of shoes. Their frictionless design makes them easily
        replaceable, which also expresses itself in the sheer
        unrepairability. Following these lines of thought, design
        practices disable not only the care for the thing, but also our
        understanding of the importance to care for our immediate
        environment.</p>
        <p>Consumer electronics become mediators of ontological
        affordances.</p>
        <p>Alternative ways of caring for companion technologies are
        found in animistic practice. Animistic epistemologies enable us
        to level the ontological field and create social ties to things.
        These epistemologies then enable different ways for caring and
        respectful relations to the non-human. In the light of the
        environmental impact of todays technologies, cared for and
        long-living companion things seem to be a desirable
        alternative.</p>
        <p>How then can we imagine our relationship to technological
        products and processes otherwise? How can we imagine their
        ontological status and our entanglement with them anew?</p>
        <p><strong>Length</strong>: 20 minutes for my presentation with
        10 minutes for Q+A (I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of Q+As, but always
        glad to have some participatory action going on)</p>
