        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>This is the first Fallow Zine, a small zine that sprang forth
        from La Jachère. This zine is basically a simple attempt to
        think collaboratively about subjects that the
        Jachère/Fallow/Brache project concerns itself with. If you are
        interest to know what these are, please have a look at the <a
        href="pages/about.html">about</a> page.</p>
        <p>There is also a playfully layouted version of this zine <a
        href="https://thgie.hotglue.me/?Fallow%20Zine%201">with
        Hotglue</a>. Definitly check that out as well!</p>
        <h2 id="lazy-tech-or-tech-for-the-lazies">Lazy tech or tech for
        the lazies</h2>
        <p>If you are interested in this issue’s theme, there was a <a
        href="notes/call-fallow-zine-1.html">call for entries</a> that is
        a bit more detailed. The Fallow Zine is open-ended. If you have
        something to add, please send it in!</p>
        <p>In my personal opinion technology should make life easier. I
        get the impression, that this is not a common goal, when
        designing and producing technology. We have so much technology
        that makes everybody’s life (peoples, plants, animals, planets
        and other things) more complex, more difficult, and definitely
        less fun. It seems that the only way to make life easier is
        through capital.</p>
        <p>The initial goal of this zine was an attempt to paint a
        different idea of technology, or dream a different dream of what
        technology could be, provide a different starting point or
        vocabulary to talk about technology. Since this idea only
        existed in my head, more or less, I was very surprised how
        others interpreted the <a
        href="notes/call-fallow-zine-1.html">call for entries</a>.</p>
        <p>Some of it occupies itself to different degrees with the
        refusal of technology, the minimization of it, not unlike the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite">Luddites</a>. It’s
        not about being anti-technology, but about drawing the line and
        stating, that we actually have more than enough technology
        already. Other entries are a bit more playful, easing the air
        and adding some lightness. And of course some of it aids in
        being lazy.</p>
        <p>So, let’s dive in. Get yourself comfy, and let us
        collaboratively refuse the onslaught of technology. Have a tea,
        eat some cookies, enjoy the moment. Here is what’s in for you in
        this issue.</p>
