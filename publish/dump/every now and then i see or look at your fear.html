        <p>every now and then i see or look at your fear and hate, your misogyny, your stupid actions, stupid ideas and stupid believes. and then i become stupid, become fearful and become full of hatred. the endless train of thought, what do i have to do against it, how am i part of the problem, how can i change it, change myself, prevent it. but then again, i choose to concentrate on what i can do, what i love and what creates robust diversity and beauty.</p>
