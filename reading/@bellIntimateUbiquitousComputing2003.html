        <p>The paper discusses a workshop that will tackle intimate
        technology through the designers lenses. There are three areas
        discussed in tech literature concerning the topic.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>1. intimacy as cognitive and emotional closeness with
        technology, where the technology (typically unidirectionally)
        may be aware of, and responsive to, our intentions, actions and
        feelings. Here our technologies know us intimately; we may or
        may not know them intimately. 2. intimacy as physical closeness
        with technology, both on the body and/or within the body. 3.
        intimacy through technology: technology that can express of our
        intentions, actions and feelings toward others.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Within this context, open source could be seen as an approach
        to intimacy by opening up the possibility for us to know and
        trust the tech. Cognitive and emotional closeness becomes
        bi-directionally.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>[…] intimate computing implies a sense of detail; it is about
        supporting a diversity of people, bodies, desires, ecologies and
        niches.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Current ubiquitous computing paradigms are still within a
        frame of mass-production and a one-solution serving-all mindset.
        Customization is practically a hoax.</p>
        <p>To go forward the workshop perceives four strategies.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>deriving understandings of people’s nuanced, day-to-day
        practices; (2) elaborating cultural sensitivities; (3)
        revisioning notions of mediated intimacy, through explorations
        of play and playfulness; and (4) exploring new concepts and
        methods for design.</li>
        </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I believe that the third approach, play, is linked to Sung’s
        concept of ambiguity (see <span class="citation"
        data-cites="sungMyRoombaRambo2007">[@sungMyRoombaRambo2007]</span>)
        and Marenko’s uncertainty (see <span class="citation"
        data-cites="marenkoAnimisticDesignHow2016">[@marenkoAnimisticDesignHow2016]</span>).</p>
