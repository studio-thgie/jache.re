        <p>The text is about an aspect of design fiction, which can make
        it so appealing. Good design fiction doesn’t lose itself in the
        description of technology and laser action, but ties into the
        ordinary and weaves the fiction into it. As an example, a scene
        from Westworld is used, in which an AI calls the protagonist to
        tell him, that they didn’t find a job for him.</p>
        <p>I need to take into account, that the design of voice
        assistant also has implications if you don’t have such a device
        at home; the difference between personal and non-personal voice
        assistants.</p>
        <p>I am also deeply impressed by this ability to analyse
        pop-culture… These thoughts about the scene seem relevant to my
        research on voice assistants:</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>The empathy the HR AI is able to evoke in Caleb — it feels
        like Caleb doesn’t want the AI to feel bad for rejecting his
        application.</li>
        <li>That Caleb is able to notice that he may in fact be talking
        to an non-human. He broaches that point with a bit of
        awkwardness as if he is also empathetic and doesn’t want to
        embarass the AI.</li>
        <li>That Sean the AI seems to not get the subtle humor of
        Caleb’s “is there a different shape I can fit myself into” line
        and so just stops responding. Which I can imagine as either a
        subtle way of handling an error state — as if the algorithm
        can’t find a ‘next state’ or whatever. <em>Or</em> it’s actually
        how a somewhat humorless human might respond — doing the audio
        equivalent of a couple of blinks and a blank stare.</li>
        <li>That Caleb politely ends the call, almost apologizing rather
        than just hanging up.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>He then goes on to extract important points for design
        fiction.</p>
        <p>The first point is <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegesis">diegesis</a>, in
        which one gets to know details about the fictional world through
        narrative. In this case here it’s that we know that an AI was
        involved in the job application, but not to what extend and a
        lot is left to our imagination.</p>
        <p>The second point is the second order read in which design
        fiction moves beyond the narrative to issues of scale and
        implications. What was needed to make this phone call between
        human and AI possible? In terms of tech, but also bureacratic
        infrastructure, business wise, etc.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>we’re using the unfolding of this moment of drama to
        prototype, in a cinematic context, through visual storytelling,
        a world with AI agents doing such things as rejecting job
        applicants. But there is all of this other material that gets
        cooked out of our breakdown and analysis — all of which was
        generated by allowing my Design Fiction mind to imagine the
        contingent circumstances that would make this moment come to
        pass in some fictional near future world.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There are three reasons to go to these extends of imagining
        what that world looks and feels like.</p>
        <ol type="1">
        <li>It’s a kind of crossfit for the imagination. It’s over the
        top, but it’s really good practice. And it’s also hard to
        actually do.</li>
        <li>It’s mental prototyping.</li>
        <li>Design fiction helps practice imagining the future, which we
        humans are realy bad with.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The diegetic prototype is explained better (just after I had
        to look it up again…). It’s a thing in the storry that hints at
        the world at large. We can imagine how the world is, just by
        this one thing.</p>
