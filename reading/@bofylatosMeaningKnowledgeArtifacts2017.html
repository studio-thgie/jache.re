        <p>“In this view, technical artifacts and humans exist as nodes
        in networks of relations. By realizing the agency of non-humans,
        we are able to see them not as simple intermediaries within
        networks of humans, but as mediators in the collective
        uncertainty management” (Bofylatos and Spyrou, 2017,
        p. 4423)</p>
        <p>This part is relevant when proposing participation as a
        strategy of sustainability, through furthering accessibility of
        a prototypical artifact.</p>
        <p>Seeing prototypes (prototypical artifacts) as assemblages is
        an interesting twist.</p>
        <p>“Thus, the meaning of an artifact can be neither solely
        embodied by the artifact itself nor inside the assemblage to
        which it belongs, but it rather lies in all the possible
        practical or mental actions that the artifact is able to
        involve.” (Bofylatos and Spyrou, 2017, p. 4424)</p>
        <p>Can this be adapted to knowledge? The knowledge bound to an
        artifact can neither be solely within nor without but resides in
        the relations we are able to spin up?obs</p>
        <p>“The artifact – or more generally, every artificial reality
        in which we live – is thus to be conceived as a place where a
        “common mind” is shaped: a place of shared behavioural and
        cognitive habits, beliefs and opinions, compared and contrasted
        viewpoints or values, the place where shared meaning resides.”
        (Bofylatos and Spyrou, 2017, p. 4425)</p>
