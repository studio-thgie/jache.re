        href="https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/01/the-internet-didnt-kill-counterculture-you-just-wont-find-it-on-instagram/">The
        internet didn’t kill counterculture—you just won’t find it on
        Instagram</a></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In an era more profoundly organized by Big Tech than our own
        elected governments, the new culture to be countered isn’t
        singular or top-down. It’s rhizomatic, nonbinary, and includes
        all who live within the Google/Apple/Facebook/ Amazon digital
        ecosystem (aka GAFA stack). With digital platforms transforming
        legacy countercultural activity into profitable, high-engagement
        content, being countercultural no longer means being
        counter-hegemonic.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The core message is, that it doesn’t matter what you do
        online; As long as you do it on the GAFA platforms it will
        profit big tech.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>What logic could possibly be upended by punks, goths,
        gabbers, or neo-pagans when the internet, a massively lucrative
        space of capitalization, profits off the personal expression and
        political conflict of its users?</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The only way out is to skip the big platforms.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>To be truly countercultural today, in a time of tech
        hegemony, one has to, above all, betray the platform, which may
        come in the form of betraying or divesting from your public
        online self.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Let’s pool crypto to book the master’s Airbnb and use the
        tools we find there to forge a forest utopia that the master
        could never survive.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The article then goes into the dissamination of e-deologies,
        which sound intregring. They spring out of the younger
        generations interaction with political future- as well as
        self-building. Personas and ideologies for the future.
        Nonetheless, they neither really know, what they are
        opposing.</p>
        <p>Similiar to the privacy problem in voice assistant (know
        about the problem, kind of don’t care or can’t care), people
        have the same problem with the big platforms. They use them
        anyway, knowingly about the inherent problems.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>What’s really messed up about this is that users, despite
        understanding that the platform’s mechanics are net-bad, still
        feel a moral responsibility to obey the
        platform-enabled-hive-mind’s rules.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This on is nice in terms of terms:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>the internet bifurcated into what became known as the
        “clearnet,” which includes all publicly indexed sites (i.e., big
        social media, commercial platforms, and anything crawled by
        major search engines) and the “darknet” or “deep web,” which is
        not publicly indexed (due to being built on anonymized,
        encrypted networks such as Tor). There were also a number of
        sites that though officially clearnet, laid the groundwork for a
        sub-clearnet space that we might think of as a “dark forest”
        zone</p>
