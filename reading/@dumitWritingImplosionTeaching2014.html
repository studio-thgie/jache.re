        <blockquote>
        <p>I have taught a course called Science and Politics for a number of years and one year in particular, it was very early in the morning, a big lecture class at 8:00am. To get to the lecture hall we all passed this little shop that sold good coffee and chocolate croissants. … And <em>just as a way of waking up</em> in the morning, I would ask people to <em>unpack</em> objects, to take a chocolate croissant and lead me through flour and chocolate and butter and sugar and coffee and <em>connect us to world histories</em> that way. I would ask people to pick an object, the T-shirt that the person sitting next to them was wearing, what was printed on it, the label, the very fact of labeling, the fibre composition. If it’s got polyester, then take me through the history of Purity Hall and research labs at Du Pont; you know, back me up into nitrogen chemistry. If it’s cotton, then back me into pesticides and the California water projects and where cotton is grown and the length of the fibre and what about what you are wearing on your chest? I would ask people, as a way of talking about science and politics, to take a pencil, a piece of paper, the architecture of the lecture hall that you walked past; pick something and get the class started by giving me an account of it.</p>
        <p>—Donna Haraway, in <em>Live Theory</em> (emphasis added)</p>
