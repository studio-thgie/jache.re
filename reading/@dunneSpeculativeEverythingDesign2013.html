        <p>There is a notion of collectiveness, but not very clearly
        defined. The assumption of inclusiveness is an error of the
        privileged. In general the authors speak of <em>designers</em>
        and <em>design practices</em> and never reflect much, who those
        could be. A reflection on the privilege of time and resources to
        follow speculative design practices is missing.</p>
        <p>Although talking of society and inclusiveness they advocate
        to work with specialists in their respective fields (ethicists,
        political scientists, economists), instead of with those, who
        are actually concerned with the implications of design.</p>
        <p>An interesting debate on the issue for and by whom
        speculative design is made, watch this discussion between Ahmed
        Ansari and Jamer Hunt.</p>
        <p>https://www.media.mit.edu/videos/knotty-objects-2015-07-16-10/</p>
        <p>Throughout the reviewed chapters (1 and 5) many references to
        artists are made.</p>
        <h2 id="discourse">Discourse</h2>
        <p>Speculative design sees itselve as a continuation of radical
        design and in this they position themselves rather
        anti-capitalist and their design practice as political
        activity.</p>
        <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
        <p>In the first chapter, titled <em>Beyond Radical Design</em>,
        Fiona Raby and Anthony Dunne advocate for the importance of
        design to imagine alternative futures. They make the point, that
        imaginative, social, and political speculation became more
        difficult since radical design and trace that cause to changes
        in global politics as well as capitalism.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>[…] we need more pluralism in design, not of style but of
        ideology and values. p. 9</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2
        id="chapter-5---a-methodological-playground-fictional-worlds-and-thought-experiments">Chapter
        5 - A Methodological Playground: Fictional Worlds and Thought
        Experiments</h2>
        <p>Already early on in the book, the authors promote looking at
        other artistic disciplines for inspiration on how to speculate
        and create fictions.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>To find inspiration for speculating through design we need to
        look beyond design to the methodological playgrounds of cinema,
        literature, science, ethics, politics, and art; to explore,
        hybridize, borrow, and embrace the many tools available for
        crafting not only things but also ideas—fictional worlds,
        cautionary tales, what-if scenarios, thought experiments,
        counterfactuals, reductio ad absurdum experiments, prefigurative
        futures, and so on. <span class="citation"

        </blockquote>
        <p>In the fifth chapter they briefly examine said disciplines on
        their potential to serve for inspiration. In their analysis
        literature as well as fine arts seem to be the most promising to
        serve the intended purpose. As many disciplines already have a
        rich discourse on <em>fictionalism</em>, they already have
        categories to distinct between what is real and what is not
        real. In design these categories would be <em>the actual</em>
        and <em>the fictional</em>.</p>
        <p>The rest of the chapter is committed to the exploration of
        possible methods for speculation with examples of where they’re
        found in other disciplines.</p>
        <h3 id="utopiadystopia">Utopia/Dystopia</h3>
        <p>The concepts of utopia/dystopia should be used as a stimulus,
        to keep ideas alive, not to actually realize them top down (like
        dictatorships) in order to measure life as it is, to how it
        could be.</p>
        <h3
        id="extrapolation-neoliberal-speculative-fiction">Extrapolation:
        Neoliberal Speculative Fiction</h3>
        <p>Most thought-provoking utopias/dystopias are extrapolations
        of free market soscieties, for example the works of Philip K.
        Dick and many others in literature. Cinematic approaches seem to
        be weaker in this, as they have to reduce aesthetics to known
        tropes. Design then should position itself in between literature
        (complete imagination) and cinema (visual tropes).</p>
        <h3 id="ideas-as-stories">Ideas as Stories</h3>
        <p>Speculative design is interested in ideas that the viewer can
        use to imagine the kind of society that would have produced
        them, its values, beliefs, and ideologies. Margaret Atwood’s
        novels are a good example of speculative design: based on actual
        research and then extrapolated while more interested in the
        social, cultural, and ethical implications of science and
        technology than the technology itself.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>For us, she is the gold standard for speculative work—based
        on real science; focused on social, cultural, ethical, and
        political implications; interested in using stories to aid
        reflection; yet without sacrificing the quality of storytelling
        or literary aspects of her work. <span class="citation"
        data-cites="dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013">[@dunneSpeculativeEverythingDesign2013,
        78]</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>One more aspect is how rich and thought-provoking fictional
        worlds can be developed from idiosyncratic starting points.</p>
        <h3 id="thought-experiments">Thought Experiments</h3>
        <p>The speculative approach could or should be seen as
        thought-experiments, not necessarily narratives or coherent
        world-building, which makes them closer to conceptual art then
        conventional design. It’s important to focus on the thought
        part, not just the experiment itself</p>
        <h4 id="reduction-ad-absurdum">Reduction Ad Absurdum</h4>
        <p>Absurdly reducing one idea to one single aspect. Thomas
        Twaites <em><a href="http://www.thetoasterproject.org/">The
        Toaster Project</a></em> is discussed.</p>
        <h4 id="counterfactuals">Counterfactuals</h4>
        <p>Another approach for speculation is the changing of a
        historical fact to see how the present would have changed. The
        <em>Attenborough Design Group</em> is discussed in which
        sustainability and emotional ties were product through the
        implementation of animal like behavior in electronic
        artifacts.</p>
        <h4 id="what-ifs">What-Ifs</h4>
        <p>This method is closely related to <em>counterfactuals</em>,
        but more foreward looking. How could the changing of a thing
        from the present influence the future.</p>
        <h3 id="fictioneers-in-denial">Fictioneers in Denial</h3>
        <p>The last part of this chapter discusses how the fictiol still
        seems to be someting <em>bad</em> for designers, while they’re
        actually involved in the creation of many fictions in their
        design practices. The authors advocate to liberate the
        fiction-making from the industry to serve society.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>We are interested in liberating this story making (not
        storytelling) potential, this dream-materializing ability, from
        purely commercial applications and redirecting it toward more
        social ends that address the citizen rather than the consumer or
        perhaps both at the same time. p. 88</p>
