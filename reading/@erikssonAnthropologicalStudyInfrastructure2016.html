        <p>Larkin is mentioned, Star is mentioned. Nothing new on that
        front. The expansion of the understanding of infrastructure not
        as mere materiality but as socio-material assemblages. But also
        the importance to study the boring things, like protocolls and
        standards.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Graham and Thrift also challenges the view that breakdowns
        are anomalies and instead consider them the default state of
        infrastructures in constant need of repair and maintenance from
        both users and experts, and that breakdowns are often not
        catastrophic but rather opportunities for learning, adaption,
        and innovation that goes beyond mere restoration (Graham &amp;
        Thrift, 2007). Graham and Thrift thus puts maintenance at the
        heart of being in a world fighting against constant entropic
        decay, and in contrast to a social theory that have tended to
        emphasize connection and assembly.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Besides being very poetically, I love this mention as it fits
        very much to my dissertation proposal. If maintenance is the
        default mode for infrastructure, we need to think participatory
        on that level, or else we’ll fail.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>They relate this perspective to postphenomenological research
        about the affect of the thingness of materiality of human
        affairs that goes beyond merely their culturally assigned
        meanings.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>What a sentence, I can’t capture it at first glance. But it
        definitly triggers my curiousness. It’s about where and how we
        get into contact with infrastructure, sometimes it’s hidden,
        sometimes it’s a barrier and sometimes it’s background
        noise.</p>
        <p>The problematic of scale is captured very nicely in the
        article. Researchers of infrastructure have to at once study the
        micro interactions of users with the infrastructure, such as
        pressing a button, but also the macro systematics. Sometimes
        things have to be researched that are related but not close,
        such as political or juridical decision-centers, and protocol
        archives.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Since infrastructures can be defined in such diverse ways,
        chooseing a method for studying them will have to be based on
        the theory being employed in each case.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This bit seems very relevant to me. I’m not sure which theory
        I would base my disseration upon yet. I guess the approach that
        I lined up so far was very close to Star’s recommendation of</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>a mixed-method approach to studying infrastructures involving
        literature and historical research together with ethnographic
        field studies and user studies across multiple sites, all done
        with an ethnographic sensibility to how people make meanings and
        how those meanings are inscribed in the built environment</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Infrastructures can create social roles (such as the
        passanger with the implementation of the metro). With regards to
        that, we could say that citizen scientist doesn’t exist before
        participatory research projects or a participatory digital image
        archive.</p>
        <p>An important takeaway from this read is the importance on
        considering the maintenance of infrastructure as something
        integral to it.</p>
