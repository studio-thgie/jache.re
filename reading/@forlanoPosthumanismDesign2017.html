        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Since at least the mid-1980s, design has been dominated by a
        human-centered and user-centered paradigm. Currently, the
        implications of technological and environmental transformations
        are challenging designers to focus on complex socio-technical
        systems. This article traces emergent discussions around
        posthumanism from across a range of disciplines and
        perspectives, and considers examples from emerging design
        practices that emphasize the interrelations between human and
        nonhuman actors. Specifically, this article reviews literature
        from actor-network theory (ANT), feminist new materialism,
        object-oriented ontology, non-representational theory, and
        transhumanism to inform the development of new methodologies and
        practices in the field of design. Finally, this article presents
        critiques of posthumanism from critical race theory and
        decolonial theory to consider how emergent design perspectives
        might better support values such as equality and justice for
        humans and nonhumans that have been traditionally ignored in
        design processes.</p>

        <p>“While not identified explicitly as posthuman design, these
        examples illustrate that considerations of the nonhuman—whether
        animals and the natural environment, or things and the
        artificial world—require new forms of expertise and open up new
        problems, questions, opportunities, and solutions for the field
        of design that it is not yet equipped for.” (<a

        <p>“1) Who or what— human/nonhuman, human/animal,
        individual/organizational/network 11 —are the user(s), and for
        whom or what should the design be desirable? 2) How, and in what
        ways—competitively/collaboratively,
        hierarchically/horizontally—are capabilities, agency, and power
        distributed across human, machines, and natural systems? 3) What
        new knowledge(s), questions, stakeholders, and partnerships are
        needed in order to adequately design for this problem? 4) How
        are ethics, 12 values, and responsibilities reflected and
        embedded throughout the design process?” (<a

        <p>“there are two primary reasons—environmental and
        socio-technical—for the exploration of theories around the
        posthuman.” (<a

        <p>““A system of thought formulated in reaction to the basic
        tenets of humanism, especially its focus on humanity rather than
        the divine or supernatural.” 18 In particular, this definition
        emphasizes the traditions of postmodernist and feminist writing,
        which reject the rational, autonomous individual and, rather,
        emphasize the partial, situated, and socially-constructed self.”

        <p>“Specifically, technological systems include technologies,
        organizations, and things. These artifacts can be understood to
        have not only affordances 21 as are commonly discussed in the
        field of design but also a politics.” (<a

        <p>“Instead, by using the language of networks of human and
        nonhuman actors, socio-technical systems, or assemblages, it is
        possible to develop a more nuanced understanding of the
        relationships between technology and society.” (<a

        2017:20</a>)</p>
        <p>“At the same time, there is a large and growing body of
        scholarship on the environment that has contributed to theories
        of the posthuman.” (<a

        <p>“in the field of sustainable design, they are still not
        widely used.” (<a

        <p>“according to ANT, it is nonhumans and their specific
        relationships to humans that make up the ‘social’” (<a

        <p>“The third mode, critical posthumanism—advocated by
        Braidotti—is based on the tradition of anti-humanism, which is
        built upon post-structuralism, feminism, and post-colonial
        theory. Critical posthumanism takes racism, sexism, colonialism,
        classism, and other -isms seriously as part of the history and
        present conditions that have been created by Western
        Enlightenment. It also acknowledges connections between humans
        and the environment.” (<a

        2017:22</a>)</p>
        <p>“As notions of the anthropocene—the proposed geologic era in
        which the human impact on the earth becomes significant and
        dominant—have captured our attention, it is clear that talking
        about design is also about the state of the planet and the
        impact of climate change. Design”makes the human” but it also
        “engineers inequalities” such that “design itself needs to be
        redesigned.” 8” (<a

        design.” 9” (<a

        <p>“Faste recommends speculative futures and histories,
        simulations, and futures scenarios as ways of considering the
        social, political, environmental, and ethical dimensions of
        intelligent systems, and encourages design practices that
        acknowledge the”reciprocal relationship that values intelligent
        systems as partners.”” (<a

        <p>“ow can we expand our purview beyond the user and their
        problems? How can we help our audience make sense of what is
        new? How do we create something for people who don’t yet have a
        need to find? How do we build empathy for every participant in a
        complex system? 9” (<a

        <p>“Thomas Wendt, on the other hand, comes at the question of
        decentering the human from a more ecological perspective,
        focusing on the inherent unsustainability of human-centered
        design in capitalist society.” (<a

        2017:26</a>)</p>
        <p>“From the perspective of critical race studies, it is not
        productive to speak of the posthuman when so many
        people—non-white, less privileged/ powerful, female, older,
        indigenous, people with disabilities, and so on—have not been
        historically included in the category of the human in the first
        place.” (<a

        2017:28</a>)</p>
        <p>“Thus, rather than focusing on the agency of things and the
        nonhuman, the panel addressed the ways things are always
        entangled with bodies and subjectivities.” (<a

        2017:28</a>)</p>
        <p>“Drawing on anthropological research, she illustrates the
        ways that Western, European values and categories are often used
        in order to describe and understand people constructed
        as”others,” rather than integrating their own self-definitions.
        Furthermore, these narratives often present a hierarchy in which
        the universal, rational, scientific, and civilized—understood as
        “European”—occupies a dominant position as compared to the
        local, embodied, subjective, and primitive—understood as
        “indigenous.”” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3MCXE5K8?page=13">Forlano
        2017:28</a>)</p>
        <p>“At the same time, these particular critiques of OOO and
        decentering the human seem to have much in common with feminist
        new materialism, in that they aim not to essentialize distinct
        categories, but rather to complicate them and illustrate the
        ways the human and nonhuman, nature and culture are mutually
        co-constitutive. Posthuman design might take up these critiques
        seriously in order to make way for a truly decolonized design
        practice.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/3MCXE5K8?page=14">Forlano
        2017:29</a>)</p>
        <p>“With new epistemologies and ontologies to help make sense of
        the current conditions, it is likely that design practices will
        also need to evolve in order to stay relevant and to cope with
        new problems and questions.” (<a
