        <p>Graphicacy as the fourth “ace” with respect to communication
        and understanding, as in the conveying of information and
        knowledge. That is, the visual display of information,
        especially in regards to maps. Cartographic visualisations can
        be evaluated from different epistemologies.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>This model [map communication model], proposed initially by
        Kola ́cˇny ́, involves a cartographer, separated from the map
        recipient in time and space, conceptualizing the ‘‘real world’’
        to produce a map.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The map-com model was striving for objectivity, truth or
        reality in maps and was predominant from 1950 - 1980. Newer
        approaches to mapping focused on cartographic visualization.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Haining, Wise, and Signoretta claim that exploratory spatial
        data analysis (ESDA) involves only simple and intuitive
        transformations of data, enabling extraction of information for
        hypotheses generation and the assessment of statistical models
        (Haining, Wise, and Signoretta 2000). Dorling and Fairbairn
        define ‘‘scientific visualization’’ as ‘‘the process of learning
        through the creation and observation of abstract images,
        providing a method for seeing the unseen’’ (Dorling and
        Fairbairn 1997, 102).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>There seems to be a gradient or spectrum between cartography
        and info-graphics. Generally this model of mapping hovers around
        “generate hypotheses, develop problem solutions and construct
        knowledge”. This model got revised in 1994 through the addition
        of the human-map interaction space.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>In this model, three continua exist: (1) the continuum from
        private realm interaction where individuals explore spatial data
        to public realm interaction where a wide audience may use a
        published map, (2) the continuum from spatial data exploration
        in which the focus is revealing unknowns to map use in which
        ‘‘knowns’’ are presented, and (3) the continuum from high
        human-map interaction to low human-map interaction.</p>

        <p>“query, reexpression, multiple views, linked views,
        animation, and dimensionality” are the basic actions that one
        can perform on cartographic visualisations.</p>
