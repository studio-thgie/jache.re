# visual methods
Stuart Hall says that culture is not only the artefacts that we produce, but also a process, or a set of practices of exchanging meaning.
Meanings, or in other words representations, influence how we behave. 
Visuals seems especially important for contemporary western societies. There is an important distinction between vision and visuality, where, as the latter means how we can is culturally constructed. Ocularcentrism describes the centrality of the visual to western societies. The scopic regime equated seeing with knowledge. The visual has become more important in modernity, and post-modernity.

Post-modernity is not only ocularcentric because images are more common, but also because we interact much more with constructed visual experiences. It became increasingly easier to manipulate images. Iean Baudrillarf coined the term simulacra for this. 

The material qualities of technologies offer affordances. Material objects to also have agency. It is argued that the digital turn and the ability to share information between humans, animals and machines makes us post human. Going with the loose visual culture can affect on us.

In a post human approach, we do not thrive for meaning, but the exploration of the perceptual, the experiential and sensory.
