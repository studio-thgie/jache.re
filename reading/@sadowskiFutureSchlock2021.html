        <blockquote>
        <p>Part of their utopia is foreclosing on our ability to imagine
        our own.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Which fits very much to [[Technologische Artefakte ohne
        Narrative]] and [[Electronics and Power Dynamics]]. The point
        is, that the tech companies utopia is often our dystopia, as in
        neo-liberal takeover of amazon, data collection in Google or
        privacy and hate speech issues with Facebook.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>But Sidewalk’s vision ignored the realities of the already
        existing built environment, proceeding as if a new city and its
        people would just be coded into existence. […] To tame the messy
        complexity of cities, Sidewalk posited a top-to-bottom model of
        full-stack urbanism, programmed for total efficiency and
        rationality. But in practice this would mean not creating a city
        from scratch but claiming territory where people already lived.
        Building the dreamscape of the future required them to first
        colonize the cityscape of the present.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>That is exactly what I’m proposing with [[Electronics and
        Power Dynamics]]. There is a colonial element to it, in that we
        are not the users of the devices, but the devices are
        techno-pedagogical in creating perfect consumers out of us.</p>
        <p>This is very political processes come in. They are important
        in governing tech to not overtake whatever they desire. In this
        particular project, the academic helped to analyse the
        nearly-inaccessible planning documents.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Sidewalk Labs had a wealth of capital and influence at its
        disposal, but the public had something that proved to be more
        effective: care and attention.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Unsettling (colonial discourse) is where I can apply my
        expertise.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The ideology of “technology,” as it is expressed by the tech
        industry and its thought leaders, is the necromancy that keeps
        this zombie capitalist system from staying in its grave.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>These corporations are now struggling against the last
        remaining limits, both politically (what the government will
        permit) and socially (what the public will tolerate).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>What I did not mention here in the notes yet, is the text’s
        attempt to motivate to believe in and act for utopias.
        Capitalism is a failed utopia, but also an example that utopias
        can become reality.</p>
