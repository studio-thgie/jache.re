<h1>Notes about miso fermentation</h1> 

I can highlight things, and pull them right into the note: 

“Japan has a very long history of using soybeans in fermented foods. Scarcely a day passes in the average Japanese home without fermented soybeans being served at the table. These soybean foods range from mniso and natto to such seasonings as shoyu (soy sauce) and ajinomoto (monosodium glutamate). Only miso is described in detail in this article; all the other foods have been briefly discussed by Smith (1) in his instructive publication "Use of United States Soybeans in Japan."” (Shibasaki and Hesseltine, 1962, p. 180) 

It even correctly citates the highlight. 

I can also “screenshot” pieces from the text: 

(Shibasaki and Hesseltine, 1962, p. 183) 

It’s a nice feature, but I can’t import it into Obsidian at the moment… 

Ok, where done here :) Now I got to export my Zotero library and my notes (In my case I have to do it manually for this demonstration. Usually it should be automatic)
