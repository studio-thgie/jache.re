        authors.14 In order to illustrate further the
        economic/environmental theme, I show students the games Railroad
        Tycoon II and CivCity: Rome. In the former, players build
        railroad empires across nineteenth-century America, Europe, and
        Africa. They must locate stations near resources, build mines
        and farms, and trade commodities to where they are most needed,
        all while trying to minimize maintenance costs of running

        economic in focus than the Civilization series. In fact, it can
        get quite complex with the selling and buying of shares.
        Nevertheless, since Sid Meier originally designed both titles,
        the similarity in game mechanics is clear, and encourages
        students to reflect on the underlying economic nature of almost
        all decisions in Civilization IV. During this unit, we discuss
        the popularity, from Karl Marx onward, of treating economics as
