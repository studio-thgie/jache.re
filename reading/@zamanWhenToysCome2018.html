        <p>“Rather than being concerned with the attribution of
        spiritual or religious power to beings and nature elements,
        Laurel was particularly interested in the way people respond to
        animistic beliefs, i.e., how seeing the world as alive could
        shape and ‘co-design’ our behaviors, decisions and creations. In
        a technological context, Laurel invites us to consider an
        opportunity design space that builds on a model that emerges
        “from the summed actions of many actors” [20:255] and in which
        the technology offers opportunities for pleasure rather than for
        utilitarian and productive purposes.”</p>
        <p>“Animistic design is characterised by four interwoven
        principles [3,23,24] . A first key animistic design principle
        accounts for the way design qualities can evoke a sense of
        agency. Rather than considering only subjects as active, and
        objects as passive, animistic design explicitly considers
        objects on an equal stand with subjects, as all agents that ‘do’
        things. Agency is not something that objects a priori have; it
        is not an innate property. Agency is conceptualized as a
        relational concept instead, as being actualized, embodied in the
        relationship between the object and the broader ecology in which
        it is interacting [23:228] . This brings us to the second and
        third key principle, namely the embodied nature of objects ,
        that act in a broader ecology. The animistic design interest in
        embodiment as a second key principle draws the attention to how
        meaning is created, how cognitive processes unfold, and how
        information is represented, not as purely existing in one agent,
        but as unfolding in relation to other agents, instead [24:61] .
        This notion of considering the broader ecology (also coined
        milieu) in which objects and subjects act upon each other and
        are entangled, is the third animistic design principle [23,24].
        It brings forth a sensitivity to multiple and heterogeneous
        points of view [3:2254] that emerge when several distinct
        objects and subjects act upon each other at an equal stand [24]
        . This ecology is not a controlled and stable, but considered as
        having a complex, unpredictable, fluid nature instead. The
        animistic design perspective embraces this power of uncertainty,
        which can be considered as a fourth principle. Instead of
        aspiring control and creating pre-defined, predictable
        human-computer interactions, animistic design embraces the
        uncertainty that emerges when various agents creatively engage
        in and cocreate different realities.”</p>

        actions, and perspectives that act upon each other often in
        uncertain and unpredictable ways [3:2251]. Animistic design

        interaction, but addresses the richness of the” (<a

        atmosphere, or circumstance” [24:58] in which various agents
        (objects and subjects) are related to each other, through
        embodied entanglements [2], and with increasingly unstable and
        uncertain boundaries [23]. We believe an animistic design
        perspective is promising to guide the analysis and exploration
        of the design qualities of connected toys.” (<a

        <p>“By doing so, we aimed to move beyond an isolated
        artefact-centred evaluation that would only present design
        instances, and reflect on the design potentialities at an
        abstraction level that potentially could cut across particular
        use situations, instead.” (<a

        <p>“The scientific value of this paper is that its animistic
        design perspective puts connected toys in a broader context of
        various agents, i.e., objects and subjects that all act upon
        each other, often in unpredictable ways. By embracing the
        uncertainty in this complex network of humans and non-humans,
        the animistic design perspective allows to explore a broad set
        of design opportunities relevant in the realm of the Internet of
        Toys.” (<a

        <p>“Analysis The analysis can be considered as a particular type
        of expert evaluation, complementing (not replacing) user and
        technical research. The instances of the three concepts that
        emerged out of the development weeks (supra), were reanalysed
        from an animistic design perspective following a 2-step
        process.” (<a

        al 2018:175</a>)</p>
        <p>“In the first analysis phase, we explored each design concept
        from the perspective of animistic design, questioning whether
        and how the design qualities would foster or inhibit 1) agency,
        2) embodiment, 3) a certain ecology of objects and subjects, and
        4) uncertainty (cf., supra). Based on the analytical lens of
        agency, we defined new codes relating to ‘autonomy’,
        ‘domination, ’simulation’, and ‘negotiation’. The combination of
        the perspective of agency with the notion of an ecology, led to
        the definition of the following new codes: ‘(in)dependence’, and
        ‘divergent interactions’. The analytical lens of embodiment and
        ecology led to an investigation and discussion of ‘boundaries’
        in the connected toys concepts. The notion of uncertainty did
        not yield new codes during the analysis, but was helpful to
        further characterize and flesh out each of the new codes
        presented above.” (<a

        <p>“The Bracelet concept hinted upon several animistic design
        principles in affording children to interact with it in an
        ecology of heterogeneous, tangible, networked objects that act
        upon each other in uncertain ways. It does not rely on the
        typical command and response pattern present in traditional
        user-interface interactions. It is indeed an essential
        characteristic of animistic design”to fit a messy, serendipitous
        process of constant reassessment, enriching open-ended
        situations” [3:2255]. The meaning of the Bracelet is incomplete
        when children do not co-construct its significance, which
        signifies the embodied nature of animistic design and echoes
        [23:228] statement that agency in animistic designs is not
        something that objects have, but only exists in relation to its
        user(s) or in its encounters with other things and data.” (<a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/878BXM3U?page=7">Zaman et
        al 2018:176</a>)</p>
        <p>“We do note, however, that design qualities can afford an
        animistic interpretation, but even without these qualities being
        present, children still have the agency to creatively bring
        these objects to live.” (<a

        <p>“Future studies on animistic design could then consider
        triangulating data in a research design that combines adult
        expert evaluations of the design qualities with an analysis of
        empirical data based on participation of children and parents.
        Doing so would allow us to actually treat the human and
        non-human activities on an equal stand, which is a key
        characteristic of animistic design, and posthumanist research in
        general.” (<a
