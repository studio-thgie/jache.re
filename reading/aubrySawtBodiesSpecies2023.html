        Younes Boundir’s scientific study on the interactions between
        seaweed organisms, anthropic pollution, and seawater on the
        Atlantic coast. Boundir’s article does not go as far as to claim
        the necessity to reduce pollution in the name of biodiversity
        and environmental justice. He simply sticks to the facts, as is
        customary in scientific journals. Here, the natural voice of the
        sea is not grounded in affective perception; it is a product of
        scientific methodology.” (<a

        visuality of contemporary scientific imagery turns images into
        “signs of cognition,” that is epistemological products that are
        “indifferent” to the viewer. Through machinic vision, images
        have become scientific, managerial, and military instruments of
        knowledge—and thus of capital and power. This involves “a
        passage from representation to presentation,” through which
        images no longer relay the subjects of “belief” or the objects
        of contemplation, instead coming to be perceived as “an
        extension of the world.” Through data visualization and
        scientific imagery, seaweed, pollution, and seawater are
        therefore naturalized into abstract objects of study, whose

        “acoustemological” method, I describe these forms of interaction
        in terms of “embodied,” “relational,” and “cumulative”

        ways of engaging with place and space-time, which I call an

        vernacular naming practices in Morocco allow for social and

        In Berber Islamic “analogical” cosmology, these territories are

        abstract voice, emerging through modern technological means of
        visualization, mapping, prediction, and management of life
        forms; it is a groundless voice, indifferent to its listeners.
        The second modality, the intimate voice of the sea, pertains to
        a local history of interaction between humans and marine life;
        this voice also manifests people’s continuous efforts to adapt
