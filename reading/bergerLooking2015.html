        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>As a novelist, essayist, and cultural historian, John Berger
        is a writer of dazzling eloquence and arresting insight whose
        work amounts to a subtle, powerful critique of the canons of our
        civilization. In About Looking he explores our role as observers
        to reveal new layers of meaning in what we see. How do the
        animals we look at in zoos remind us of a relationship between
        man and beast all but lost in the twentieth century? What is it
        about looking at war photographs that doubles their already
        potent violence? How do the nudes of Rodin betray the threats to
        his authority and potency posed by clay and flesh? And how does
        solitude inform the art of Giacometti? In asking these and other
        questions, Berger alters the vision of anyone who reads his
        work</p>

        <ul>
        <li>rupture between humankind and nature through capitalism</li>
        <li>before that, animals were “central”, but not through
        economic means, but through the imagination of messengers and
        promises and through invitation</li>
        <li>how we can see the animals, the animals can see us.
        ascribing power to the way animals look (at us)</li>
        <li>through our differences, with animals, there is a commoness.
        we’re same because we’re equally different</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“The beavers are perhaps the only remaining example, the last
        monument to that animal intelligence…”</p>
        <ul>
        <li>the animal/pet as a mirror of how we treat earth as a whole
        as well as ourselves</li>
        <li>nowadays, the animals have retreated to signifiers, have
        become looked-at objects from acting subjects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>“The image of a wild animal becomes the starting-point of a
        daydream: a point from which the day-dreamer departs with his
        back turned.”</p>
        <ul>
        <li>zoos as a symbol of colonial power</li>
        <li>zoos as images, cages as frames</li>
        <li>zoos as the monument to the dissappearance of the animals
        from our everyday lifes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The text definitly radicalised me.</p>
