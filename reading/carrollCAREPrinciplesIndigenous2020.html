        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Concerns about secondary use of data and limited
        opportunities for benefit-sharing have focused attention on the
        tension that Indigenous communities feel between (1) protecting
        Indigenous rights and interests in Indigenous data (including
        traditional knowledges) and (2) supporting open data, machine
        learning, broad data sharing, and big data initiatives. The
        International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within
        the Research Data Alliance) is a network of nation-state based
        Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that
        developed the ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’
        (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and
        Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars,
        non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles
        are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of
        data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination
        among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing
        data-centric approach represented in the ‘FAIR Guiding
        Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’
        (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The CARE
        Principles build upon earlier work by the Te Mana Raraunga Maori
        Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty
        Network, Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait
        Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous Indigenous
        Peoples, nations, and communities. The goal is that stewards and
        other users of Indigenous data will ‘Be FAIR and CARE.’ In this
        first formal publication of the CARE Principles, we articulate
        their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles,
        and present examples of their application.</p>

        and interests in data about their peoples, communities,
        cultures, and territories is part of reclaiming control of data,
        data ecosystems, data science, and data narratives in the
        context of open data and open science.” (<a
        href="zotero://select/library/items/2CX4TVXF">Carroll et al.,
        2020, p. 2</a>)</p>
        <p>The wording of ecosystems and narratives are particularly
        interesting compared to the wording of cost-efficiency and
        optimizing. Where as FAIR is about being efficient, CARE is
        about the people, communities and epistemologies behind the
        data.</p>
        <p>The CARE practices and principles come out of the need to
        realize indigenous peoples human rights within indigenous lived
        worlds. It’s an active stance against colonizers epistemicide.
        The corpus of indigenous data is way more inclusive and specific
        than what FAIR described.</p>
        <p><a
        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GLX6QQKC?page=3&amp;annotation=5APV3DSF">Go
        to annotation</a>“Indigenous Peoples’ data comprise (1)
        information and knowledge about the environment, lands, skies,
        resources, and non-humans with which they have relations; (2)
        information about Indigenous persons such as administrative,
        census, health, social, commercial, and corporate and, (3)
        information and knowledge about Indigenous Peoples as
        collectives, including traditional and cultural information,
        oral histories, ancestral and clan knowledge, cultural sites,
        and stories, belongings.” (<a

        2020, p. 3</a>)</p>
        <p>How does that compare to bioscience data?</p>
        <p>The graphic confirms my thoughts, (<a
        href="zotero://select/library/items/2CX4TVXF">Carroll et al.,
        2020, p. 4</a>). CARE is much more people focused, whereas FAIR
        is focused on data.</p>

        <p>I’d love to see some best practice examples. Nonetheless, I
        like how CARE sees itself as working together with FAIR,
        indirectly criticizing it, but also delivering the solution to
        the problem.</p>
