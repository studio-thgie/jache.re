## Abstract
Concerns about secondary use of data and limited opportunities for benefit-sharing have focused attention on the tension that Indigenous communities feel between (1) protecting Indigenous rights and interests in Indigenous data (including traditional knowledges) and (2) supporting open data, machine learning, broad data sharing, and big data initiatives. The International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group (within the Research Data Alliance) is a network of nation-state based Indigenous data sovereignty networks and individuals that developed the ‘CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance’ (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics) in consultation with Indigenous Peoples, scholars, non-profit organizations, and governments. The CARE Principles are people– and purpose-oriented, reflecting the crucial role of data in advancing innovation, governance, and self-determination among Indigenous Peoples. The Principles complement the existing data-centric approach represented in the ‘FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship’ (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). The CARE Principles build upon earlier work by the Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data Sovereignty Network, US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network, Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective, and numerous Indigenous Peoples, nations, and communities. The goal is that stewards and other users of Indigenous data will ‘Be FAIR and CARE.’ In this first formal publication of the CARE Principles, we articulate their rationale, describe their relation to the FAIR Principles, and present examples of their application.

The wording of ecosystems and narratives are particularly interesting compared to the wording of cost-efficiency and optimizing. Where as FAIR is about being efficient, CARE is about the people, communities and epistemologies behind the data.

The CARE practices and principles come out of the need to realize indigenous peoples human rights within indigenous lived worlds. It’s an active stance against colonizers epistemicide. The corpus of indigenous data is way more inclusive and specific than what FAIR described.

How does that compare to bioscience data?

The graphic confirms my thoughts, ([Carroll et al., 2020, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/2CX4TVXF)). CARE is much more people focused, whereas FAIR is focused on data.

I’d love to see some best practice examples. Nonetheless, I like how CARE sees itself as working together with FAIR, indirectly criticizing it, but also delivering the solution to the problem.
