        <p>“The Europe I seek to provincialize or decenter is an
        imaginary figure that remains deeply embedded in clich ́ ed and
        shorthand forms in some everyday habits of thought that
        invariably subtend attempts in the social sciences to address
        questions of political modernity in South Asia.” (<a

        without these and other related concepts that found a climactic

        <p>The ideas coming out of European thought and theory, brought
        into the world through the colonizers, also build parts of the
        foundation through which said colonizers can be criticized.</p>

        to annotation</a>“Fanon’s struggle to hold on to the
        Enlightenment idea of the human—even when he knew that European
        imperialism had reduced that idea to the figure of the
        settler-colonial white man—is now itself a part of the global
        heritage of all postcolonial thinkers.” (<a

        p. 5</a>)</p>
        <p>The European colonial rule broke the intellectual chain of
        it’s colonies, reducing their thoughts to the matter of
        historical research, while not treating their own thought the
        same, as in, keeping Marx and Weber <em>alive</em>.</p>
        <p>Historicism was an important colonizers tool to position
        Europe ahead and above the colonies. Stagist theories being an
        defining factor in that, placing a “not yet” against a “now” by
        the colonies. India has opted out of this, at least in terms of
        who is able to be citizen. India declared that all citizens,
        educated or literate or not, are fully capable citizens and are
        allowed to vote.</p>

        to annotation</a>“The history and nature of political modernity
        in an excolonial country such as India thus generates a tension
        between the two aspects of the subaltern or peasant as citizen.
        One is the peasant who has to be educated into the citizen and
        who therefore belongs to the time of historicism; the other is
        the peasant who, despite his or her lack of formal education, is
        already a citizen.” (<a

        the two aspects of nationalism that Homi Bhabha has usefully
        identified as the pedagogic and the performative.” (<a

        p. 10</a>)</p>
        <p>There is further a very strong tendency in European thought
        and critique, to ascribe un- or underdevelopment to the
        colonizes, especially to the figure of the “peasant”, under the
        umbrella term “uneven development”.</p>

        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/HNX7NEYV?page=12&amp;annotation=3NVR5W45">Go
        to annotation</a>“By explicitly critiquing the idea of peasant
        consciousness as “prepoliti­ cal,” Guha was prepared to suggest
        that the nature of collective action by peasants in modern India
        was such that it effectively stretched the cate­ gory of the
        “political” far beyond the boundaries assigned to it in Euro­
        pean political thought.” (<a
        href="zotero://select/library/items/IB28R3QY">Chakrabarty, 2007,
        p. 12</a>)</p>
        <p>Another important critique by Guha was, that indian political
        processes of power are less related to capitalism then European
        thought would have it.</p>
        <p>The author goes on to critique two assumptions:</p>

        coeval with the human, and think from the as­ sumption that the
        question of being human involves the question of being with gods
        and spirits.51 Being human means, as Ramachandra Gandhi puts it,
        discovering “the possibility of calling upon God [or gods]
        without being under an obligation to first establish his [or
        their] reality.”” (<a
