## Abstract
This special issue suggests that the need to examine the entangled lives of species, selves and other beings through a multisensory perspective is crucial and timely. Developing on a sensory analysis, one that emerges through what Anna Tsing refers to as the ‘arts of noticing’ (2015), this introductory paper explores how both nonhuman and human lives are intertwined, and how their close examination can guide anthropologists in their ability to capture the subtleties of more-than-human engagement, connection and relatedness. Through articles within this issue from Australian anthropology and beyond, we ask how becoming-with more-thanhumans helps us to construct a post-humanist analysis in the combination of sensory anthropology and multispecies anthropology. Through a combination of these two fields, the paper suggests, anthropology can take up the opportunity to think about animals as subjects, through our ability to communicate beyond language and to engage in a more meaningful way through interspecies knowledge-making.

## Notes

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BXH92PQ?page=7&annotation=QDF3YEW3)“as Ingold (2013b, pp. 6–9) puts it, how can we formulate our enquiries by joining with and learning from the more-than-human?” ([Fijn and Kavesh, 2021, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/H58TVQSM))

-   multispecies ethnography essentially gives the non-human the same evaluation as to the human, having a good look at the political, economic and cultural forces at play
-   nontheless Ingold urges as to account for the differences between all more-than-human and proposes a phenomenological approach
-   Kohn suggest further to also look at the entanglements

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BXH92PQ?page=9&annotation=FVQPW754)“We suggest that as researchers we need to enlarge our methodological premises in examining the entangled lives of species, selves and other beings. By developing a sensory analysis, one that emerges through what Tsing (2015, p. 37) refers to as the ‘arts of noticing’, anthropology can develop a deeper appreciation of both human and more-than-human lives connected through shared spaces” ([Fijn and Kavesh, 2021, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/H58TVQSM))

> [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/4BXH92PQ?page=13&annotation=YHFHIWW7)“Sensory ethnography has previously been communicated within academia as quite separate from multispecies anthropology, or interdisciplinary human–animal studies (Classen, 1993, 1997; Howes, 2003; Stoller, 1997). Our approach within this issue is to indicate how both sensory and multispecies anthropology have the capacity to guide anthropologists in their ability to capture the subtleties of more-than-human engagement, connection and relatedness (see Howes, 2019, p. 24)” ([Fijn and Kavesh, 2021, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/H58TVQSM))
