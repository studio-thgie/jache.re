        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>“Data and its technologies now play a large and growing role
        in humanities research and teaching. This book addresses the
        needs of humanities scholars who seek deeper expertise in the
        area of data modeling and representation. The authors, all
        experts in digital humanities, offer a clear explanation of key
        technical principles, a grounded discussion of case studies, and
        an exploration of important theoretical concerns. The book opens
        with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data
        modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical
        concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part
        of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging
        exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data
        modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling
        standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities
        practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and
        how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies
        which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources,
        and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in
        digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary
        chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data
        modeling in the digital humanities context. This book is a
        unique and invaluable resource for teaching and practising data
        modeling in a digital humanities context”–</p>

        modeling systems and tools early on, ideally even before
        students reach university. We need to emphasize the scholarly
        importance of modeling decisions even as we teach our students
        how to create and publish digital materials, whether those are
        games or research data, or digital archives or creative works.
        The “how” of digital humanities needs to be accompanied by an
        equally compelling “why” that expresses the motivations and
        ideologies that animate these digital materials. And in a
        complementary way, we need to teach students to attend to the
        modeling decisions our tools are making for us, or preventing us
        from making, and teach them to be resourceful about keeping
        their data from being too closely entrapped by specific tools.”
