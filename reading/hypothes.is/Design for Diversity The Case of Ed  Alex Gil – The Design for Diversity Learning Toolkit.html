        <li><p>These design philosophies focus on the concept of minimal
        computing, which includes a holistic analysis of overall system
        costs in creating and, as importantly, maintaining online
        resources. — <a

        <li><p>Diversity is pure Public Relations. It has less to do
        with justice, equality and change than it does with glossy
        pamphlets. — <a

        <li><p>In many years of listening to marginalized peers listing
        obstacles to participation in the popular genres of digital
        humanities, several common themes resurfaced: lack of resources,
        steep learning curves, and limited time. — <a

        <li><p>the difference between using off-the-shelf tools out of
        necessity or choice was a central part of the problem — <a
        href="https://hyp.is/a_Z9KOG4Ee24IfcB94nCQA/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/">Updated

        <li><p>Most students in the United States—regardless of
        identity—are being introduced to digital humanities through a
        mere handful of tools: Omeka, TEI, Voyant, Scalar, Carto, etc.
        These “easy” tools have something in common: students learn very
        little about computation, systems, networks, and by extension
        the social implications of the modes of production that they
        enable. Even more importantly, use of these tools hides the
        vectors of control, governance and ownership over our cultural
        artifacts. — <a

        <li><p>No matter how or where you read, the production of these
        editions is beholden to a framework of some sort, and that
        framework has consequences at scale that go beyond the edition
        itself. Ed intervenes in these collaterals through both the
        process of production it asks for and the final product itself.

        <li><p>A high cost is equal here to a complete loss of control
        over all aspects of a project: ownership of the data, design of
        the presentation layer, decision-making on the content, etc. —

        <li><p>the obstacles to divest from the metaphors of graphical
        user interfaces — to begin to understand the machine as a
        symbolic device — are substantial. — <a

        <li><p>as opposed to the average introduction to Digital
        Humanities course or a TEI-centered learning environment, Ed
        allows me to teach a wider range of fundamental and
        proto-universal literacies in one semester—enough to enable
        students to be independent producers of mature digital editions
        they control, and a solid foundation for other digital
        humanities work — <a
