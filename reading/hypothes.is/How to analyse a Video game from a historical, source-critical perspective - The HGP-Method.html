        <li><p>Clara Fernandez-Vara’s “Introduction to Video Game
        Analysis”, who basically divides game analysis into context
        analysis, a game overview and the analysis of formal elements,
        each of these parts divided into an elaborate matrix of
        subdivisions (Fernández-Vara 2015). Another good overview is
        “Game Research Methods” by Petri Lankoski and Staffan Björk
        (2015), which provides an anthology of interdisciplinary
        approaches that include qualitative and quantitative research,
        mixed methods and even using games as a research method. — <a

        <li><p>Florian Niedlich describes pop culture as both
        aesthetically stimulating and politically meaningful artefacts
        that can be understood as significant elements of a pop cultural
        arena of consent and resistance and complex interventions in
        cultural processes and social struggles (Niedlich 2012, 11-12).

        <li><p>Barthes understands myths as discursive elements that
        could only become part of such discourses because meaning is
        ascribed to them. On this premise, any element that contains
        meaning can be understood as a text and can be analyzed as such.
        Barthes accordingly extends discourse analyses from pure textual
        elements to further levels, to images and objects. With regard
        to game studies, at the latest with Ian Bogost’s concept of
        procedural rhetoric, one must also consider processes,
        performative practices, and actions for such content analyses. —

        <li><p>In a first step – the production analysis (1) – we
        examined the origin of the games and their historical context.
        In a second – more detailed – step, the games themselves as
        sources – the product analysis (2) – have been examined for form
        and content. Then, where possible, we examined the reception of
        the game – the reception analysis (3). Building on this
        analysis, in a final step we have elaborated several dominant
        myths (4) for each game. — <a

        <li><p>we decided to focus our analysis on three vectors: story,
        audio-visual aesthetics and game mechanics — <a

        <li><p>Petri Lankoski and Staffan Björk circumvent this problem
        in their “Formal Analysis of Gameplay” by stating that at least
        the events, that build up a narrative usually follow a certain
        path despite intermediate ramifications and that a certain
        outcome is always unavoidable. — <a

        <li><p>All this ultimately led us to develop an approach to
        games that could be described as “observational play”. This
        approach partly follows Participant Observation — <a

        <li><p>There was always a notebook next to us for this, and we
        took screenshots whenever possible. These notebooks resembled
        diaries in a way. — <a

        <li><p>In terms of story/narrative, we focused on the setting,
        backstory, characters, dialogue, texts and world building in the
        games. In terms of audio-visual design, we focused on lighting
        direction, colour spectrum, environmental architecture,
        character and monster design, sound and music. In terms of game
        mechanics we focused on the underlying mechanics (puzzle,
        action, combat, survival, etc.), conflict resolution options
        (combat, negotiation, escape, stealth, etc.), virtual resource
        management, storage options, possible ethical decision making
        options, and, in general, the degree of interactivity and the
        type of interaction between humans and the game. — <a

        do justice to the heterogeneity of the medium. — <a
