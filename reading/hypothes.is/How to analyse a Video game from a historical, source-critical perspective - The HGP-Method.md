## Highlights
- Clara Fernandez-Vara’s “Introduction to Video Game Analysis”, who basically divides game analysis into context analysis, a game overview and the analysis of formal elements, each of these parts divided into an elaborate matrix of subdivisions (Fernández-Vara 2015). Another good overview is “Game Research Methods” by Petri Lankoski and Staffan Björk (2015), which provides an anthology of interdisciplinary approaches that include qualitative and quantitative research, mixed methods and even using games as a research method. — [Updated on 2022-09-17 10:07:23](https://hyp.is/wyVetjZfEe2Lgo9Mdtb1bQ/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public

- Florian Niedlich describes pop culture as both aesthetically stimulating and politically meaningful artefacts that can be understood as significant elements of a pop cultural arena of consent and resistance and complex interventions in cultural processes and social struggles (Niedlich 2012, 11-12). — [Updated on 2022-09-17 10:10:19](https://hyp.is/K-jupDZgEe2d68_wGPLjWA/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public

- Barthes understands myths as discursive elements that could only become part of such discourses because meaning is ascribed to them. On this premise, any element that contains meaning can be understood as a text and can be analyzed as such. Barthes accordingly extends discourse analyses from pure textual elements to further levels, to images and objects. With regard to game studies, at the latest with Ian Bogost’s concept of procedural rhetoric, one must also consider processes, performative practices, and actions for such content analyses. — [Updated on 2022-09-17 17:53:15](https://hyp.is/19D_qjagEe2N2Jfpp_2kJA/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public

- In a first step – the production analysis (1) – we examined the origin of the games and their historical context. In a second – more detailed – step, the games themselves as sources – the product analysis (2) – have been examined for form and content. Then, where possible, we examined the reception of the game – the reception analysis (3). Building on this analysis, in a final step we have elaborated several dominant myths (4) for each game. — [Updated on 2022-09-18 12:00:32](https://hyp.is/vLxW1jc4Ee2Q6FtClra_KA/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public

- we decided to focus our analysis on three vectors: story, audio-visual aesthetics and game mechanics — [Updated on 2022-09-18 12:02:09](https://hyp.is/9fyRmjc4Ee2bDCukwoGm2w/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public

- Petri Lankoski and Staffan Björk circumvent this problem in their “Formal Analysis of Gameplay” by stating that at least the events, that build up a narrative usually follow a certain path despite intermediate ramifications and that a certain outcome is always unavoidable. — [Updated on 2022-09-21 17:43:35](https://hyp.is/J7nG8jnEEe2hkceBxlY7mg/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public

- All this ultimately led us to develop an approach to games that could be described as “observational play”. This approach partly follows Participant Observation — [Updated on 2022-09-21 17:44:35](https://hyp.is/SvgMbjnEEe2TwjNb8fpk-A/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public

- There was always a notebook next to us for this, and we took screenshots whenever possible. These notebooks resembled diaries in a way.  — [Updated on 2022-09-21 17:46:05](https://hyp.is/gUy1JjnEEe2qtsNIv9dvQQ/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Reflexion, as in thematic analysis after Brown and Clark
- In terms of story/narrative, we focused on the setting, backstory, characters, dialogue, texts and world building in the games. In terms of audio-visual design, we focused on lighting direction, colour spectrum, environmental architecture, character and monster design, sound and music. In terms of game mechanics we focused on the underlying mechanics (puzzle, action, combat, survival, etc.), conflict resolution options (combat, negotiation, escape, stealth, etc.), virtual resource management, storage options, possible ethical decision making options, and, in general, the degree of interactivity and the type of interaction between humans and the game. — [Updated on 2022-09-21 17:46:23](https://hyp.is/i-NDajnEEe2Zz4NYr9uyUg/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public

- We have also found that rigid protocol templates do not do justice to the heterogeneity of the medium.  — [Updated on 2022-09-21 17:53:21](https://hyp.is/hOo7djnFEe2gyD_SjUdGHw/hgp.hypotheses.org/1754) — Group: #Public
