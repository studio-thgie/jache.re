        <li><p>intimacy indexes relations of closeness — <a

        <li><p>intimacy is thought to occur between individuals and the
        nature of their closeness is often articulated in terms of
        affection, love, romance and/or eroticism — <a
        href="https://hyp.is/p3LIpLZzEe2NTzdHUalmvg/caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/2020/11/14/intimacy/">Updated

        <li><p>it is not only interpersonal intimacy of a positive
        nature that may operate as a site of knowledge but also intimacy
        among people, places, and things, as well as relations of
        violence — <a

        <li><p>the Caribbean becomes a region by virtue of its component
        nations’ similar (though not uniform) socio-historical and
        structural processes — <a
        href="https://hyp.is/9BYW1LZzEe2qZ18bGMIV0Q/caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/2020/11/14/intimacy/">Updated
        on 2023-02-27 08:54:25</a> — Group: #Public</p></li>
        <li><p>One product of such intimacies – ethno-racially mixed
        people – are thought to be particularly indexical of the region.
        The Garifuna are one example. They are a maroon people who came
        into being from the intimacies between escaped African enslaved
        and Carib people in St. Vincent in the seventeenth century. — <a
        href="https://hyp.is/JIzIlLZ0Ee2NU-sWMBZb_w/caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/2020/11/14/intimacy/">Updated
        on 2023-02-27 08:55:46</a> — Group: #Public</p></li>
        <li><p>Yet the intimacies that developed within and among these
        groups – erotic, economic, affective, familial, political etc. –
        did not always align with colonial modes of being and were often
        positioned as perverse, excessive, and subversive. Analyzing the
        various iterations of these intimate relations functions as a
        method of reckoning with the Caribbean’s ongoing legacy as the
        laboratory of modernity and global capitalism. — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: I understand intimacy two-fold, after this
        article. Intimacy as something forced into, through the violent
        displacement and locking into a common place, the Caribbean.
        And, Caribbean intimacy, which was suppressed by the colonizers.
        The outcome is a specific form of Caribbean intimacy, often
        syncretic, out of histories of violence, but creating new
        relations between people, cultures, non-humans, and place.</li>
