        <li><p>It suggests, first, that many are deeply invested in the
        Twitter network as a political tool, and that some worry that
        Twitter’s interests might be aligned with the financial and
        political status quo they hope to challenge. — <a

        <li><p>These providers offer complex algorithms to manage,
        curate, and organize these massive networks. But there is a
        tension between what we understand these algorithms to be, what
        we need them to be, and what they in fact are. We do not have a
        sufficient vocabulary for assessing the intervention of these
        algorithms. We’re not adept at appreciating what it takes to
        design a tool like Trends – one that appears to effortlessly
        identify what’s going on, yet also makes distinct and motivated
        choices. We don’t have a language for the unexpected
        associations algorithms make, beyond the intention (or even
        comprehension) of their designers (Ananny 2011). — <a

        <li><p>Most importantly, we have not fully recognized how these
        algorithms attempt to produce representations of the wants or
        concerns of the public, and as such, run into the classic
        problem of political representation: who claims to know the mind
        of the public, and how do they claim to know it? — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: But do they want to represent the wants or
        concerns of the public?</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Twitter has repeatedly stated that their Trends algorithm
        is not a simple measure of volume — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: It doesn’t help then, that they add the amount
        of tweets with a given # then. There is a problem of explaining
        the inner workings as well.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>For instance, one substantial revision occurred in May
        2010 when Twitter announced it was removing Justin Bieber from
        the Trending Topics list. — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: And thus admit they can manually interfere with
        Trends.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Twitter Trends is just one of many information practices
        that claim to know or represent the will of the people: public
        opinion polls, census surveys, man-on-the-street interviews,
        voting mechanisms. — <a

        <li><p>With both of these tensions at work, the politics of the
        artifact, i.e. the workings of the Trends algorithm, become just
        one piece of a greater puzzle: the politics of representation. —

        <li><p>It claims to know the public through an algorithmic
        assessment of their complete traces — <a

        <ul>
        <li>Annotation: Reminds me of Seeing like an infrastructure by
        Nick Seavers and how music recommender system measure people
        only through their interaction with the algorithm.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>But further, the criteria that animate the Trends
        algorithm also presume a shape and character to the public they
        intend to measure, and in doing so, help to construct publics in
        that image. — <a

        <li><p>These algorithms produce not barometric readings but
        hieroglyphs.  At once so clear and so opaque, they beg to be
        read as reliable measures of the public mind, as signs of “us.”
        But the shape of the “us” on offer is by no means transparent. —
