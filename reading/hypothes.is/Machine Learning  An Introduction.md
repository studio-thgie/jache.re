## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Traditionally, software engineering combined human created rules with data to create answers to a problem. Instead, machine learning uses data and answers to discover the rules behind a problem.

- There are multiple forms of Machine Learning; supervised, unsupervised , semi-supervised and reinforcement learning. — [Updated on 2023-04-30 08:23:50](https://hyp.is/kjvphOcfEe2IkBfDd5HZug/towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0) — Group: #Public

- The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jaquard weaves flowers and leaves — Ada Lovelace — [Updated on 2023-04-30 08:25:57](https://hyp.is/3iDuqOcfEe2IkwuXRWsbsw/towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0) — Group: #Public

- Bayesian probability means that we think of probability as quantifying the uncertainty of an event. — [Updated on 2023-04-30 08:28:14](https://hyp.is/L_vy9OcgEe2i6KMfcbVagQ/towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0) — Group: #Public

- In supervised learning, the goal is to learn the mapping (the rules) between a set of inputs and outputs. — [Updated on 2023-04-30 08:30:20](https://hyp.is/et0ydOcgEe2kewf0nPetBA/towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0) — Group: #Public

- If the model is over-trained, we cause over-fitting to the examples used and the model would be unable to adapt to new, previously unseen inputs. — [Updated on 2023-04-30 08:30:26](https://hyp.is/fkliKucgEe2OhI_aeIVh4Q/towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0) — Group: #Public

- In unsupervised learning, only input data is provided in the examples. There are no labelled example outputs to aim for. — [Updated on 2023-04-30 08:38:41](https://hyp.is/pW7nwOchEe2YJAugRgOxlA/towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0) — Group: #Public

- If you’re familiar with psychology, you’ll have heard of reinforcement learning. If not, you’ll already know the concept from how we learn in everyday life. In this approach, occasional positive and negative feedback is used to reinforce behaviours. — [Updated on 2023-04-30 08:44:11](https://hyp.is/ak_1yuciEe2m7ju43fvY-w/towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-an-introduction-23b84d51e6d0) — Group: #Public
