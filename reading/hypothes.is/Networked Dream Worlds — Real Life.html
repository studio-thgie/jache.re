        and other promised benefits for individuals. Its ubiquity and
        instantaneity will make it possible for groups of people to
        engage in distant educational opportunities, distributed
        scientific experiments, and job-training simulations. — <a

        <li><p>In short, enhanced connectivity promises accurate,
        efficient, integrated urban operations. Yet 5G’s rewards, we are
        told, will radiate far beyond metropolitan areas, delivering
        robust connectivity to historically underserved markets and
        rural areas that have never had access to broadband. We can
        bring the “smart city” to the farm, the refugee camp, and the
        one-room schoolhouse. — <a

        <li><p>What we need, Crawford argues, is not 5G as it’s
        currently blueprinted, but “neutral, open physical [fiber]
        infrastructure.” Such a system seems unimaginable in the U.S.,
        she suggests, because of “decades of political maneuvering by
        the enormous private [telecom] companies…, a lack of leadership
        at the federal level, and the invisibility of this entire policy
        area.” — <a

        <li><p>Similar concerns — about invasion and irradiation — have
        accompanied other new technologies, from electricity to radio
        to, not long ago, 4G. The electromagnetic spectrum, in its
        material ambiguity, lends itself to multiple imaginaries and
        applications. To regulators and carriers, it’s real estate to be
        parceled up and sold; it’s territory to be fought for. To
        technoenthusiasts, it’s an ethereal realm of possibility and
        opportunity. To others, it’s a commons. As Greta Byrum suggested
        to me, public airwaves are like public lands, and we have to ask
        who should benefit from their use. To still others, it’s the
        Wild West: With cars, pacemakers, and mobile payment apps all
        linked through the ether, some worry (as this New Yorker article
        details) that the 5G world presents new opportunities to shady
        entrepreneurs, hackers, and cyberterrorists. And to some members
        of the public, electromagnetic waves are an invasive,
        penetrating, irradiating force, blasting us with the data of
        billions of connected objects. — <a
