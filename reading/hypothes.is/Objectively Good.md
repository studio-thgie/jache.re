## Page Notes
## Highlights
- How many signs is too many? At what point do signs, including adverts, impinge on our freedom to relate to our environment? Where is the line between being guided and being conditioned towards a particular experience of the outside world? — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:10:25](https://hyp.is/mny-PnyKEe2wQJ99JF4MCQ/bulletpointsmonthly.com/2022/12/15/objectively-good-god-of-war-ragnarok) — Group: #Public

- In effect, there’s an unwritten contract between game and player, according to which you’re guaranteed a smooth experience, like the layout of an Ikea store, on condition that you waive any right to be surprised. — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:15:38](https://hyp.is/VLoVvHyLEe24Hp_yW_MphQ/bulletpointsmonthly.com/2022/12/15/objectively-good-god-of-war-ragnarok) — Group: #Public

- What’s genuinely interesting here, though, is how the regimented psychogeography of Ragnarök determines our response to it, and ultimately normalises itself. — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:16:30](https://hyp.is/c8OPpnyLEe2xfr-WdHOczw/bulletpointsmonthly.com/2022/12/15/objectively-good-god-of-war-ragnarok) — Group: #Public

- But in its ‘form’ or structure (the crucial aspect for Marcuse) it doesn’t want to be interpreted, it wants to be obeyed. — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:17:59](https://hyp.is/qQKY2HyLEe2FyOtZvx1IqQ/bulletpointsmonthly.com/2022/12/15/objectively-good-god-of-war-ragnarok) — Group: #Public

- if there is a utopian dimension in Ragnarök, it’s in its (accidental) almost Brechtian knack for explaining what it’s doing to you in plain terms, as if it wants the artifice of its formal designs to be interrogated. — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:19:04](https://hyp.is/z53oRHyLEe2hILvok3lLvw/bulletpointsmonthly.com/2022/12/15/objectively-good-god-of-war-ragnarok) — Group: #Public

- Ragnarök’s spaces — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:21:23](https://hyp.is/IsLEkHyMEe2macc98Aj2ZQ/bulletpointsmonthly.com/2022/12/15/objectively-good-god-of-war-ragnarok) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Ragnarök's spaces could be unfolded through Michael Nitsche's conceptualization of spaces in and around games.
