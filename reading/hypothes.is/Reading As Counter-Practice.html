        <li><p>It is easy to forget that writing is a technology, a tool
        for communication that was invented and variously iterated over
        time. — <a

        <li><p>various kinds of text: emails, text messages, posts on
        social media, product descriptions on retail websites, reviews,
        articles, recipes, essays, books, reports, etc. The list can go
        on and on. But these various texts invite or require different
        forms of reading. We might glance, we might skim, we might do
        little more than search for keywords, we might read
        deliberately, or we might find ourselves immersed in what Wolf
        calls deep reading. We can imagine these modes of reading
        existing on a spectrum of effort and care with many other points
        in between. — <a

        <li><p>When I do read something that is intellectually
        demanding, I find my mind wandering from the page after only a
        few moments. I assume that by now this is just how most people
        feel about reading and that some may not even know that there is
        any other way. — <a

        tell the story of “how information lost its body.” — <a

        <li><p>It’s worth acknowledging at this juncture that the
        skimming sort of reading that has become our default can be
        understood as a coping mechanism. — <a

        <li><p>I find it useful in this context to occasionally remind
        myself that I cannot read everything and that it would not be
        good for me to try. Better, perhaps, to read fewer things well.
        As is often the case, acknowledging and embracing our
        limitations can be freeing. — <a

        <li><p>I wonder how often we are in a kind of fog because we
        have allowed our minds to aimlessly, frenetically, and
        perpetually dart from one thing to another, disrupting our
        minds’ capacity to form memories and generate meaning. — <a
