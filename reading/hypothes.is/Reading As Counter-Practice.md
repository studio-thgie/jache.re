## Page Notes
## Highlights
- It is easy to forget that writing is a technology, a tool for communication that was invented and variously iterated over time. — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:09:57](https://hyp.is/F13LdnilEe25BIuzkq0DAA/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public

- various kinds of text: emails, text messages, posts on social media, product descriptions on retail websites, reviews, articles, recipes, essays, books, reports, etc. The list can go on and on. But these various texts invite or require different forms of reading. We might glance, we might skim, we might do little more than search for keywords, we might read deliberately, or we might find ourselves immersed in what Wolf calls deep reading. We can imagine these modes of reading existing on a spectrum of effort and care with many other points in between. — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:12:08](https://hyp.is/ZXBYznilEe2t6xcROxKchA/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public

- When I do read something that is intellectually demanding, I find my mind wandering from the page after only a few moments. I assume that by now this is just how most people feel about reading and that some may not even know that there is any other way. — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:13:00](https://hyp.is/hLxjHHilEe2iJIfXv5zr6w/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: So I am not alone?
- In How We Became Posthuman, Katherine Hayles sets out to tell the story of “how information lost its body.” — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:13:58](https://hyp.is/py0zfHilEe2ZG6uFEDqZoQ/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public

- “The page,” Illich observed, “lost the quality of soil in which words are rooted.” — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:14:06](https://hyp.is/q_OCqHilEe20EmOGdFG-KA/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public

- the material form of the text mediates our relationship to the text — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:15:15](https://hyp.is/vk2zGnilEe2Huof6LWwLRQ/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: I wonder if this approach towards text informed visual studies aspect of the site of audiencing?
- It’s worth acknowledging at this juncture that the skimming sort of reading that has become our default can be understood as a coping mechanism. — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:18:37](https://hyp.is/TY8BWnimEe2aleMFb9GYaQ/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public

- I find it useful in this context to occasionally remind myself that I cannot read everything and that it would not be good for me to try. Better, perhaps, to read fewer things well. As is often the case, acknowledging and embracing our limitations can be freeing. — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:19:12](https://hyp.is/Yh6dQnimEe28Q_tybrgU9w/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: I can, again, relate to that… And I should try.
- I wonder how often we are in a kind of fog because we have allowed our minds to aimlessly, frenetically, and perpetually dart from one thing to another, disrupting our minds’ capacity to form memories and generate meaning. — [Updated on 2022-12-10 17:20:34](https://hyp.is/ktSC5HimEe2al39Xjtpnuw/theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/reading-as-counter-practice) — Group: #Public
