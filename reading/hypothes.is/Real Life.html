        <li><p>At the heart of this ambition is something that we might
        call “synaesthetic fallacy”: the technological promise that all
        data is translatable into other data, and that these processes
        of translation are impartial and organic. — <a

        <li><p>She pointed out that much of our understanding of
        communicative diversity and technological mediation between
        different senses and lexicons comes from differently abled
        thinkers and inventors: for example, textual descriptions of
        images, text-to-speech software, and EEG technology that
        converts brainwaves to speech. Within critical disability
        theory, these technologically mediated processes are never
        positioned as impartial; they are always treated as relational
        and value-laden, unfolding at the intersection of many different
        ways of knowing. — <a

        <li><p>By contrast, the contemporary use of synaesthesia as a
        metaphor in interaction design implies  the existence of an
        objective set of sensory correlations that can be brought out by
        technology alone. The idea that we need gadgets to “translate”
        the world around us is used to justify the omnipresence of
        gadgetry in every facet of life, lending both scientific
        legitimation and an aura magic to the idea of the interactive or
        animate city. — <a

        <li><p>Such projects cloak themselves in the language of
        synergy: an intimacy between the built environment and the
        people living in it that is so profound it becomes a sort of
        shared consciousness. In reality, though, it is a convenient way
        for private interests to seize greater control over the city
        space through digital overlay. — <a

        <li><p>There is a latent violence to this action of hand to
        throat (“touch gently,” the video warns); but unlike in Paik and
        Moorman’s work, which embraces the easy slippage between
        violence and tenderness, instrumentalization and intimacy, the
        Playtronica video deliberately neutralizes this charge, opting
        for a minimalist, block-color, sans-serif neatness. — <a

        <li><p>Technological ubiquity under neoliberalism largely
        flattens the natural complexities of communication, narrowing
        down ways to interact and to know — <a

        long as it exists within the context of this article. I can
        relate a lot :)</li>

        <li><p>The success of technologies like Playtronica points to a
        real desire for communication between human and non-human
        worlds, something that we seem more ready to believe in when it
        involves technological mediation. — <a

        <li><p>The more our interactions with the world are mediated by
        technologies that gloss over the frictions and ambiguities by
        which we acquire meaning for each other, the more we drift
        towards commodification, because it is through ambiguity that we
        resist quantifiability. — <a

        <li><p>But the ambition of perfect communication between
        entities is a trap. The interaction of machines and human bodies
        can be exciting terrain precisely because it is fraught with
        complex processes of negotiation. Ambiguity and complexity is
        engagement: when we fail to recognize this, and instead
        prioritize the generalized efficiency of conversions between
        different sorts of data, we edge towards the commodification of
        all our interactions. — <a

        <li><p>On his blog, theorist Steven Shaviro takes up Marx’
        notion of commodity fetishism, writing that “commodities
        actually are alive: more alive, perhaps, than we ourselves are.
        They ‘appear,’ or stand forth, or ‘shine’ (the word Marx uses
        is scheinen) as autonomous beings” — they seem to possess the
        ability to act and feel independently of us. Animating the world
        via technological appendages doesn’t increase our engagement
        with it; instead, it bolsters processes of commodification,
        because, according to Shaviro, the commodities possess more
        agency than we ourselves do. Emphasizing interactivity for
        interactivity’s sake renders the world meaningless until it is
        activated by technology — then technology (and capital) becomes
        the dominant life force. — <a

        <li>Annotation: Fetish, and by extension animism, Marx and IoT
        brought together.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><p>Our relationship with technology, though, is a chaotic
        one; in fact all interaction is by definition chaotic. Any form
        of play that does not center this chaos — which instead
        envisages human-machine interaction as a seamless unbroken
        circuit — will always subordinate the human to the level of
        object, rather than elevating an object to the level of the
        human. In attempting to make the world more animate, we risk
        de-animating ourselves. — <a
