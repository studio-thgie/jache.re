        maximization, and one could say preemptive buildup, of soil
        nutrient capacity beyond the renewal pace of soil ecosystems. —

        <li><p>In this conception, soil is not just a habitat or medium
        for plants and organisms; nor is it just decomposed material,
        the organic and mineral end product of organism activity.
        Organisms are soil. A lively soil can only exist with and
        through a multispecies community of biota that makes it, that
        contributes to its creation. — <a

        <li><p>These developments are not disconnected from worries
        about the capacities of soil to continue to provide services (a
        range of calculations are deployed to value the services of
        biota) or from a notion that accounts for soil fertility
        according to its ability to provide yield. — <a

        <li><p>Often conceptualized as soil »communities« even as they
        are based on »trophic« relations – who eats whom – foodweb
        models emphasize a living world below, teeming with life and yet
        always fragile. — <a

        <li><p>Interdependent models such as the foodweb disturb the
        unidirectionality of care conceived within the linear timescapes
        of productionist time traditionally centered in human-crop care
        relations. Relational approaches to the cycles of soil life in
        themselves can be read as disruptions to productionist linear
        time, simply because ecological relations require taking a
        diversity of timescales into account. — <a

        <li><p>Yet foodweb models also affect relations to soil for how
        they turn humans into full participant »members« of the soil
        community rather than merely consumers of its produce or
        beneficiaries of its services. — <a

        <li><p>Carers are themselves often cared for by someone else.
        Reciprocity of care is asymmetric and multilateral, collectively
        shared. A caring conception of soil emphasizes this embeddedness
        in relations of interdependency. Caring for soil communities
        involves making a speculative effort toward the acknowledgment
        that the (human) carer also depends on soil’s capacity to »take
        care« of a number of processes that are vital to more than her
        existence. — <a

        <li><p>A care approach needs to look not only at how soils and
        other resources produce output or provide services to humans but
        also at how humans are specifically obliged, how they are
        providing. — <a

        <li><p>The »human« mostly features as an unbalanced irruption in
        soil’s ecological cycles – or a victim in the case of soil

        <li><p>But in the spirit of staging matters of fact, scientific
        things, as matters of care, it seems to be a more fertile option

        environmental thought and practice, across the social sciences

        <li><p>One could say that successful scientific models owe part
        of their power to their figurative potential. Beyond science,
        the foodweb is a charged figuration of soil relations, which I
        read here as going in the sense of restoring what Thompson calls
        the »spirit of the soil,« by which he points at an understanding
        of human activity as part of the life of the earth and »the
        spirit of raising food and eating it as an act of communion with
        some larger whole.« — <a
