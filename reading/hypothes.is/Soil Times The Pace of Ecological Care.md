## Page Notes
## Highlights
- »Soils have become a matter of concern and care not just for what they provide for humans but for ensuring the subsistence of soil communities more broadly.« — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:44:13](https://hyp.is/U2vWxHyPEe2JYrf3hoQTJQ/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Soil enables us to get into direct relation with the land, place and the environment we're embedded in.
- productionism — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:46:57](https://hyp.is/q1p4mnyPEe2kSuMglOcDIg/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- We’re Treating Soil Like Dirt. — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:47:40](https://hyp.is/znNuNnyPEe21ffOGpTymNg/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: wordplay, the connotations are interesting
- These developments confirm a consistent trend in modern management of soils to move from maintenance – for instance, by leaving parts of the land at times in a fallow state – to the maximization, and one could say preemptive buildup, of soil nutrient capacity beyond the renewal pace of soil ecosystems. — [Updated on 2022-12-15 16:57:09](https://hyp.is/e934ZnyQEe2F1VeNRROPRA/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Maximizing yield by putting soil into overdrive. The part until here is also a good showcase on how ideology and capitalism form our understanding (in the coming paragraph as well) and relation to nature
- Worster’s account of the living conditions of farmers who outlived the destruction of successive dust bowls to see the return of intensified agriculture and successful grand-scale farming are also stories of discontent, debt, and anxiety, echoing farmer experiences worldwide living under the pressures of production. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 07:51:15](https://hyp.is/iLC85n9pEe2P1JuKuIQhvg/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: From a perspective on soil (productionism) to the slow disintegration of the agricultural class
- So though the timescale of soil productionist exploitation discounts the future by focusing on the benefit of present generations, the present is also discounted, as everyday practices, relations, and embodied temporalities of practitioners embedded in this industrious speeded-up time are also compressed and precarious. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 07:51:22](https://hyp.is/jHb0in9pEe21iL-AJ9Tr5w/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- In the utilitarian-care vision, worn-out soils must be »put back to work« through soil engineering technologies — [Updated on 2022-12-19 07:53:49](https://hyp.is/zE65in9pEe26njclU07z3Q/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: "utilitarian-care" is such a strong terminology
- From the perspective of a feminist politics of care in human–soil relations, this is a form of exploitative and instrumentally regimented care, oriented by a one-way anthropocentric temporality. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 07:55:59](https://hyp.is/MXaven9qEe22n2tYNrTxgQ/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- Capitalo-centered — [Updated on 2022-12-19 07:58:42](https://hyp.is/kyyhIH9qEe2pORcOgtxMFQ/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Although shifting, there is still a very heavy capitalist leaning in how human-soil relations are regarded
- A feminist approach to more than human care would at the very least open a speculative interrogation: Cui bono?21 service for whom? as a question that reveals the limitations of a service approach to transform human–soil relations while it remains based on conceiving naturecultural entities as resources for human consumption, thus interrogating an understanding of soils that posits them as either functions or services to »human well-being« — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:03:38](https://hyp.is/QwWqTH9rEe2vA0v4sNCxTA/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: From unilateral relations to bi-directional care relations
- productionist and service logic — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:05:26](https://hyp.is/g8qQ2H9rEe2fZh93yWuIaw/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: two different perspectives on nature
- That this has not been an obvious move is attested by ecologists who claim for a change in soil’s definitions — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:14:28](https://hyp.is/xprRan9sEe21n8t-18-Oxg/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: defining perspectives on soil
- In this conception, soil is not just a habitat or medium for plants and organisms; nor is it just decomposed material, the organic and mineral end product of organism activity. Organisms are soil. A lively soil can only exist with and through a multispecies community of biota that makes it, that contributes to its creation. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:15:30](https://hyp.is/6-8y5H9sEe2_dGdVgaMy8Q/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- These developments are not disconnected from worries about the capacities of soil to continue to provide services (a range of calculations are deployed to value the services of biota) or from a notion that accounts for soil fertility according to its ability to provide yield. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:17:24](https://hyp.is/L5Kwyn9tEe2qeXcskB3rVQ/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Although having a multi-species approach, still moving within productionist perspectives
- Soils as living, for instance, create other questions about effects of human interventions to technologically enhance impoverished soils, however well intentioned. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:20:29](https://hyp.is/nd_EtH9tEe2Q0VsDgdA2YQ/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- foodweb — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:22:26](https://hyp.is/493fFH9tEe2cUBM1HA9F9A/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- Often conceptualized as soil »communities« even as they are based on »trophic« relations – who eats whom – foodweb models emphasize a living world below, teeming with life and yet always fragile. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:24:06](https://hyp.is/Hy1u_n9uEe2KgXPMw1fwsw/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- Interdependent models such as the foodweb disturb the unidirectionality of care conceived within the linear timescapes of productionist time traditionally centered in human-crop care relations. Relational approaches to the cycles of soil life in themselves can be read as disruptions to productionist linear time, simply because ecological relations require taking a diversity of timescales into account. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:25:15](https://hyp.is/SH0rRn9uEe20dzPpCvmEmg/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- Yet foodweb models also affect relations to soil for how they turn humans into full participant »members« of the soil community rather than merely consumers of its produce or beneficiaries of its services. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:26:55](https://hyp.is/hEOX8H9uEe2mcZdr5Lkj0g/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: From productionist and service perspectives to a full multispecies one.
- Carers are themselves often cared for by someone else. Reciprocity of care is asymmetric and multilateral, collectively shared. A caring conception of soil emphasizes this embeddedness in relations of interdependency. Caring for soil communities involves making a speculative effort toward the acknowledgment that the (human) carer also depends on soil’s capacity to »take care« of a number of processes that are vital to more than her existence.  — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:27:49](https://hyp.is/o-a6Gn9uEe2XUHcUMTa7EQ/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- A care approach needs to look not only at how soils and other resources produce output or provide services to humans but also at how humans are specifically obliged, how they are providing. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:31:55](https://hyp.is/Np0IMn9vEe2n799XeMXlPw/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: what is our duty and obligation in care towards the world?
- The »human« mostly features as an unbalanced irruption in soil’s ecological cycles – or a victim in the case of soil pollution – rather than as a »member« of a soil community. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:33:53](https://hyp.is/fNwQ1n9vEe2rwYtAVcXujQ/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- But in the spirit of staging matters of fact, scientific things, as matters of care, it seems to be a more fertile option to attempt an articulation of different horizons of practice and modes of relating to soil through their potential to transform human–soil relations. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:34:54](https://hyp.is/oWgPQH9vEe2P3O9G0I0qUw/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: defining community through practice, not definitions
- anthropedology — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:35:28](https://hyp.is/tbdcTn9vEe2_0mtXBvUZSw/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public

- Desituated storylines of Anthropos-centered relations need to be challenged if are we to offer situated humans a place within, rather than above, other earth creatures, in acknowledgment of specific modes of agency: a vital task for environmental thought and practice, across the social sciences and humanities, but also for exceeding collective imaginations. — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:37:54](https://hyp.is/DKwn3H9wEe20GBuR93edWw/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: what perspective do we inhibit in the future?
- One could say that successful scientific models owe part of their power to their figurative potential. Beyond science, the foodweb is a charged figuration of soil relations, which I read here as going in the sense of restoring what Thompson calls the »spirit of the soil,« by which he points at an understanding of human activity as part of the life of the earth and »the spirit of raising food and eating it as an act of communion with some larger whole.« — [Updated on 2022-12-19 08:39:24](https://hyp.is/Qm0U2n9wEe2whA_Q07XYtw/www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-journal/soil-times-the-pace-of-ecological-care/) — Group: #Public
