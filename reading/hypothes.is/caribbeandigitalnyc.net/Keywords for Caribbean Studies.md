- it is not only interpersonal intimacy of a positive nature that may operate as a site of knowledge but also intimacy among people, places, and things, as well as relations of violence — [Updated on 2023-02-27 08:52:52](https://hyp.is/vRgQzrZzEe2uGHtJFnH_vw/caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/2020/11/14/intimacy/) — Group: #Public

- the Caribbean becomes a region by virtue of its component nations’ similar (though not uniform) socio-historical and structural processes — [Updated on 2023-02-27 08:54:25](https://hyp.is/9BYW1LZzEe2qZ18bGMIV0Q/caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/2020/11/14/intimacy/) — Group: #Public

- One product of such intimacies – ethno-racially mixed people – are thought to be particularly indexical of the region. The Garifuna are one example. They are a maroon people who came into being from the intimacies between escaped African enslaved and Carib people in St. Vincent in the seventeenth century. — [Updated on 2023-02-27 08:55:46](https://hyp.is/JIzIlLZ0Ee2NU-sWMBZb_w/caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/2020/11/14/intimacy/) — Group: #Public

- Yet the intimacies that developed within and among these groups – erotic, economic, affective, familial, political etc. – did not always align with colonial modes of being and were often positioned as perverse, excessive, and subversive. Analyzing the various iterations of these intimate relations functions as a method of reckoning with the Caribbean’s ongoing legacy as the laboratory of modernity and global capitalism. — [Updated on 2023-02-27 08:59:34](https://hyp.is/CqyrurZ0Ee2pvt9aouXMkg/caribbeandigitalnyc.net/keywords/2020/11/14/intimacy/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: I understand intimacy two-fold, after this article.

Intimacy as something forced into, through the violent displacement and locking into a common place, the Caribbean. And, Caribbean intimacy, which was suppressed by the colonizers. The outcome is a specific form of Caribbean intimacy, often syncretic, out of histories of violence, but creating new relations between people, cultures, non-humans, and place.
