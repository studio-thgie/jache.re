## Page Notes
## Highlights
- These design philosophies focus on the concept of minimal computing, which includes a holistic analysis of overall system costs in creating and, as importantly, maintaining online resources. — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:16:32](https://hyp.is/iXvtXOG3Ee28GN8w1Uokxg/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public

- Diversity is pure Public Relations. It has less to do with justice, equality and change than it does with glossy pamphlets. — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:16:43](https://hyp.is/kAmbzuG3Ee26rNu5EWWUeQ/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public

- In many years of listening to marginalized peers listing obstacles to participation in the popular genres of digital humanities, several common themes resurfaced: lack of resources, steep learning curves, and limited time. — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:20:54](https://hyp.is/JhgvDuG4Ee2qWLPGPKx03w/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public

- the difference between using off-the-shelf tools out of necessity or choice was a central part of the problem — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:22:51](https://hyp.is/a_Z9KOG4Ee24IfcB94nCQA/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public

- Most students in the United States—regardless of identity—are being introduced to digital humanities through a mere handful of tools: Omeka, TEI, Voyant, Scalar, Carto, etc. These “easy” tools have something in common: students learn very little about computation, systems, networks, and by extension the social implications of the modes of production that they enable. Even more importantly, use of these tools hides the vectors of control, governance and ownership over our cultural artifacts. — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:23:10](https://hyp.is/dv3BXuG4Ee2aqztibMJmjg/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public

- No matter how or where you read, the production of these editions is beholden to a framework of some sort, and that framework has consequences at scale that go beyond the edition itself. Ed intervenes in these collaterals through both the process of production it asks for and the final product itself. — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:26:43](https://hyp.is/9cA6gOG4Ee2-xd_4In8g9Q/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public

- A high cost is equal here to a complete loss of control over all aspects of a project: ownership of the data, design of the presentation layer, decision-making on the content, etc. — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:34:42](https://hyp.is/E17bIuG6Ee2a4qfjMeol9Q/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public

- the obstacles to divest from the metaphors of graphical user interfaces — to begin to understand the machine as a symbolic device — are substantial. — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:42:38](https://hyp.is/LwEN1uG7Ee2PDkNbSoLXYA/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public

- as opposed to the average introduction to Digital Humanities course or a TEI-centered learning environment, Ed allows me to teach a wider range of fundamental and proto-universal literacies in one semester—enough to enable students to be independent producers of mature digital editions they control, and a solid foundation for other digital humanities work — [Updated on 2023-04-23 11:44:37](https://hyp.is/dfDVtOG7Ee2t4-MeB6dflg/des4div.library.northeastern.edu/design-for-diversity-the-case-of-ed-alex-gil/) — Group: #Public
