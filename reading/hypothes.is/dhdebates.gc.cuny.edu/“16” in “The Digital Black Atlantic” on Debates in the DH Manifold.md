## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Unfortunately, the virtual identities within these videogames are far less diverse, resulting in videogames often becoming sites of the enactment of fantastic dreams of the majority demographic categories of both developers in the industry and players: white and male. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:11:48](https://hyp.is/dr8sAupsEe2JrQN5EAq6jg/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Such videogames are sites where a particular version of the avatar dream manifests. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:12:00](https://hyp.is/fXtoCOpsEe2PX7d-6oJMpg/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- In this chapter we broadly question the imaginings of Africa and the avatars of African characters within the videogame medium and the impacts of these representations on the phantasms held by gamers. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:14:07](https://hyp.is/yYIKVOpsEe2YgdOCh5XqjA/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- The blended identities experienced through African game characters result in varied responses both from people who may feel aspects of their own heritages are being represented in these videogames and those who merely perform identity tourism — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:14:45](https://hyp.is/4DVHFupsEe2x1cOk47w0Eg/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Finally, we reexamined the coping strategies through the lens of the racial and ethnic socialization (R/ES) model that provides an integrative approach to empirically observed cross-generational patterns of sharing information and worldviews about being part of one’s racial/ethnic group. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:18:31](https://hyp.is/Zwv-zuptEe2ardd_QnNrwQ/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- As computing infiltrates everyday life, work in anthropology and psychology has investigated the development of new “intersubjective relationships” between humans and machines, including machines serving as proxies for our identities. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:21:06](https://hyp.is/wxM6wOptEe2uPYs0XyJDPA/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- This is in line with previous research that defines the construction of the wild and natural dream of Africa (e.g., national parks in colonial zones) as an “ideological formation” or through the lens of “environmental colonialism.” — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:40:25](https://hyp.is/dcqstOpwEe2Aw6PmmCzObA/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Some other examples, such as Resident Evil 5, portray Africa as the stereotypical dangerous “dark continent” while conveying a white privilege-based outlook. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:40:49](https://hyp.is/hFsSyOpwEe2tdiv5MK6ycw/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- In our examples, players regularly mobilized sarcastic remarks to draw attention to the racist content of the videogames or to other problems in the way the videogames handle serious issues. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:42:05](https://hyp.is/sXeKyupwEe2UuR9SEk7r_g/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- lthough they play the white avatar during the game, ironically, they both identify with the “enemy” zombies while talking about their experiences. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:42:49](https://hyp.is/y9POpupwEe2KZf9EdVtrtg/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Instead of using sarcasm on a personal level, these players use it on a societal level to address a greater issue, while still displaying their personal convictions. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:44:02](https://hyp.is/90aI7upwEe2AxVOtk3pJag/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Trolling is defined as “deliberate, deceptive, and mischievous” behavior in social networks that mobilizes shock value to facilitate aggressive feedback. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:44:47](https://hyp.is/EiV8BupxEe2pel8NRg-u7A/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Although an initial instinct might be to mark these examples as sarcasm or irony, on closer examination, it is possible to see that, instead of contributing to a critical framework about discussing the issues of representation and racism, these reviews instead operate to normalize or even strengthen these issues. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:45:39](https://hyp.is/MSlN2upxEe2ZPZM626xsdQ/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- From this viewpoint it is possible to assume that the sarcasm/irony category could be considered to be “positive” trolling that generates creative allegories that contribute to wider critical outlooks, whereas the trolling category just works to cement the inequalities. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:45:58](https://hyp.is/PFpVFOpxEe2q4ueuJ14Ysw/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- These comments are trying to construct a middle-way while still keeping up the appearances of being “sensitive to both sides.” — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:48:23](https://hyp.is/kvQVQOpxEe2DbDteqVGxJw/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- We found that topics such as Africa, race, ethnicity, and gender, as well as slavery in particular, are tackled in nonconfrontational and low-key manners by some videogames. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:48:32](https://hyp.is/mGtnEupxEe2XDMe2hG5d5Q/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Although it should be recognized that these examples are from a game review message board and players naturally discuss videogames from a gameplay perspective, this blindness becomes identifiable as a strategy when it is observed as prevalently as is the case here. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 13:55:09](https://hyp.is/hNlUkupyEe2ow4c1NVk4Ag/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Occasionally some comments underscore the harsh conditions of life in Africa as the only true representation of the reality of Africa. In this viewpoint, any representation that does not adhere to these harsh “truths” may be considered inauthentic or a poor representation. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 14:00:53](https://hyp.is/Ua6nuupzEe2f6hOGIwrfqA/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Related to the previous strategy but distinct from it, some comments underscore Africa as a bleak, underdeveloped, and unsafe place. These approaches do not debate the authenticity of any representation; instead they portray figurative and literal “darkness” and danger as inherent characteristics of Africa that may also permeate the people and cultures within it. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 14:01:38](https://hyp.is/bIYI0OpzEe2ms8scnEmJ_A/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- To explore potential distinctions between affective responses of players to racially perceived stimuli, we applied the R/ES model to analyze the themes of discussion emerging from 102 reviews of five videogames: Resident Evil 5, Assassin’s Creed: Liberation, Assassin’s Creed IV Black Flag: Freedom Cry, Playing History 2: Slave Trade, and Democracy 3 Africa — [Updated on 2023-05-04 14:03:50](https://hyp.is/u3YGeupzEe2AziPb1F9kdA/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public

- Videogame players and developers alike are caught up in a complex loop of recapitulating and negotiating old and new stereotypes grounded in colonial visions that were used to justify heinous ills ranging from chattel slavery to war in postcolonial settings. — [Updated on 2023-05-04 14:05:40](https://hyp.is/_UqfSOpzEe2uTkvXdZ9Keg/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097) — Group: #Public
