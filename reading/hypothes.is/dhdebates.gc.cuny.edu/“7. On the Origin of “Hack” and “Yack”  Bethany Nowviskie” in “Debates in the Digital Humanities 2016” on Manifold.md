## Highlights
- So, when Dave Lester, a software developer working at CHNM, quipped “More hack; less yack!” it made a silly kind of sense. Specifically, it made sense as a comment on the dominant structure of academic conferences, not as a condemnation of the character and value of discourse-based humanities scholarship. — [Updated on 2023-03-08 16:39:39](https://hyp.is/b_s00r3HEe2ann9oZQ8aIA/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/a5a2c3f4-65ca-4257-a8bb-6618d635c49f) — Group: #Public
