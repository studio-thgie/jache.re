## Page Notes
## Highlights
- Instead, such texts have a purely “material” origin—they can only be described in terms of mathematical properties such as frequency, distribution, degree of entropy, and so on. — [Updated on 2023-03-20 16:40:58](https://hyp.is/nBjPgMc1Ee2k4m93SgABWg/hannesbajohr.de/en/2023/03/11/on-artificial-and-post-artificial-texts/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: In the case of machine-learning, the base material is subject-generated text. But, it is transformed through algorithms. ChatGPT wouldn't be that powerful without our texts.
