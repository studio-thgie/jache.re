## Page Notes
## Highlights
- There is a lot of low-hanging fruit out there on the networks+humanities tree, and they ought to be plucked by those brave and willing enough to do so. However, that does not give us an excuse to apply networks to everything. — [Updated on 2023-04-12 07:59:31](https://hyp.is/MYxiXNj3Ee2M5Ud442f47Q/journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/demystifying-networks-by-scott-weingart/) — Group: #Public

- Methodology appropriation is dangerous. Even when the people designing a methodology for some specific purpose get it right—and they rarely do—there is often a score of theoretical and philosophical caveats that get lost when the methodology gets translated. — [Updated on 2023-04-12 07:59:50](https://hyp.is/PKJd_tj3Ee2tJ9e5yGLMDA/journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/demystifying-networks-by-scott-weingart/) — Group: #Public

- As it stands now, network science is ill-equipped to deal with multimodal networks. 2-mode networks are difficult enough to work with, but once you get to three or more varieties of nodes, most algorithms used in network analysis simply do not work. — [Updated on 2023-04-12 08:08:53](https://hyp.is/gCmL3Nj4Ee2Ga_vgMmfKhw/journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/demystifying-networks-by-scott-weingart/) — Group: #Public

- Humanistic data are almost by definition uncertain, open to interpretation, flexible, and not easily definable. Node types are by definition concrete; your object either is or is not a book. Every book-type thing must share certain unchanging characteristics. This reduction of data comes at a price, one that some argue traditionally divided the humanities and social sciences. — [Updated on 2023-04-12 08:12:17](https://hyp.is/-e8KPNj4Ee2v3lPUa4uUWw/journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/demystifying-networks-by-scott-weingart/) — Group: #Public

- Any network analysis approach must subscribe to and live with that duality of objects. Humanists face problems from the outset: data that do not fit neatly into one category or the other, complex situations that ought not be reduced, and methods that were developed with different purposes in mind. However, network analysis remains a viable methodology for answering and raising humanistic questions—we simply must be cautious, and must be willing to get our hands dirty editing the algorithms to suit our needs. — [Updated on 2023-04-12 08:36:24](https://hyp.is/WJKg3Nj8Ee2ufb-hVg6CBw/journalofdigitalhumanities.org/1-1/demystifying-networks-by-scott-weingart/) — Group: #Public
