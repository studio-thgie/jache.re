things to do to understand text:

- visualize single texts
- measure features of text
- identify distinctive words
- find or organize works
- model literay forms
- model social boundaries
- unsupervised modeling

## Highlights
- One of the main ways computers are changing the textual humanities is by mediating new connections to social science. The statistical models that help sociologists understand social stratification and social change haven’t in the past contributed much to the humanities, because it’s been difficult to connect quantitative models to the richer, looser sort of evidence provided by written documents. — [Updated on 2023-03-26 19:47:22](https://hyp.is/Qzt61Mv-Ee2S3jc7UGcXyw/tedunderwood.com/2015/06/04/seven-ways-humanists-are-using-computers-to-understand-text/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Computers help connect knowledge stored in unstructured text to knowledge stored in structured data.
- This isn’t the only way to approach text analysis; historically, humanists have tended to begin instead by first choosing some aspect of text to measure, and then launching an argument about the significance of the thing they measured. I’ve done that myself, and it can work. But social scientists prefer to tackle problems the other way around: first identify a concept that you’re trying to understand, and then try to model it. — [Updated on 2023-03-26 20:37:15](https://hyp.is/OwOX-swFEe26vEdlHSbSaQ/tedunderwood.com/2015/06/04/seven-ways-humanists-are-using-computers-to-understand-text/) — Group: #Public
    - Annotation: Or, in other words further down "modeling-to-explain and modeling-to-predict".
