        <li><p>Unfortunately, the virtual identities within these
        videogames are far less diverse, resulting in videogames often
        becoming sites of the enactment of fantastic dreams of the
        majority demographic categories of both developers in the
        industry and players: white and male. — <a

        <li><p>The avatar dream is a “culturally shared vision of a

        <li><p>In this chapter we broadly question the imaginings of

        <li><p>The blended identities experienced through African game

        <li><p>finally reintegrated these analyses after identifying the
        most significant commonalities in the coping strategies

        <li><p>Finally, we reexamined the coping strategies through the
        lens of the racial and ethnic socialization (R/ES) model that
        provides an integrative approach to empirically observed
        cross-generational patterns of sharing information and
        worldviews about being part of one’s racial/ethnic group. — <a

        <li><p>R/ES is a process by which families prepare their

        <li><p>The importance and complexity of sarcasm and irony in
        human communication and cognitive experience have been

        <li><p>This is in line with previous research that defines the
        construction of the wild and natural dream of Africa (e.g.,
        national parks in colonial zones) as an “ideological formation”

        <li><p>Some other examples, such as Resident Evil 5, portray
        Africa as the stereotypical dangerous “dark continent” while

        <li><p>In our examples, players regularly mobilized sarcastic
        remarks to draw attention to the racist content of the

        serious issues. — <a

        <li><p>Instead of using sarcasm on a personal level, these
        players use it on a societal level to address a greater issue,
        while still displaying their personal convictions. — <a

        <li><p>Trolling is defined as “deliberate, deceptive, and

        <li><p>Although an initial instinct might be to mark these
        examples as sarcasm or irony, on closer examination, it is
        possible to see that, instead of contributing to a critical
        framework about discussing the issues of representation and
        racism, these reviews instead operate to normalize or even
        strengthen these issues. — <a
        href="https://hyp.is/MSlN2upxEe2ZPZM626xsdQ/dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/the-digital-black-atlantic/section/b7352d4e-5602-4f8d-9297-a0b2ac700097">Updated

        <li><p>From this viewpoint it is possible to assume that the
        sarcasm/irony category could be considered to be “positive”
        trolling that generates creative allegories that contribute to
        wider critical outlooks, whereas the trolling category just
        works to cement the inequalities. — <a

        <li><p>These comments are trying to construct a middle-way while
        still keeping up the appearances of being “sensitive to both

        <li><p>We found that topics such as Africa, race, ethnicity, and
        gender, as well as slavery in particular, are tackled in
        nonconfrontational and low-key manners by some videogames. — <a

        <li><p>Although it should be recognized that these examples are
        from a game review message board and players naturally discuss
        videogames from a gameplay perspective, this blindness becomes
        identifiable as a strategy when it is observed as prevalently as
        is the case here. — <a

        <li><p>Occasionally some comments underscore the harsh
        conditions of life in Africa as the only true representation of
        the reality of Africa. In this viewpoint, any representation
        that does not adhere to these harsh “truths” may be considered
        inauthentic or a poor representation. — <a

        <li><p>Related to the previous strategy but distinct from it,
        some comments underscore Africa as a bleak, underdeveloped, and
        unsafe place. These approaches do not debate the authenticity of
        any representation; instead they portray figurative and literal
        “darkness” and danger as inherent characteristics of Africa that
        may also permeate the people and cultures within it. — <a

        <li><p>To explore potential distinctions between affective
        responses of players to racially perceived stimuli, we applied
