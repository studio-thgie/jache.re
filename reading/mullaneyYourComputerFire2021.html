        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>“This book sounds an alarm: after decades of being lulled
        into complacency by narratives of technological utopianism and
        neutrality, people are waking up to the large-scale consequences
        of Silicon Valley-led technophilia. This book trains a spotlight
        on the inequality, marginalization, and biases in our
        technological systems, showing how they are not just minor bugs
        to be patched, but part and parcel of ideas that assume
        technology can fix–and control–society”– Back cover</p>

        <p>Disasters can be the necessary means of change. Nonetheless,
        most of the our current problem with technology is through and
        by white tech-bros, who have little understanding of the
        political and social implications of their technologies, or of
        the world in general…</p>

        those with the least power in society, there is usually a long
        lag between the problems being noticed or cared about by people
        in charge and becoming seen as important enough or disturbing
        enough to warrant solving.” (<a

        <p>As those in power decide, and put into place, upon the
        technologies for society and communities, it is always the
        marginalized who suffer first and the longest. The problems of
        said technologies are often by design, not by accident, as in
        Facebooks in-built voyeurism. And, this has been ongoing since
        forever. Although known, and repeating patterns, those in power
        always find slightly changed ways to prevent the prevention the
        next disaster and abuse. All on little evidence that the
        proposed tech will solve what it’s supposed to solve. State,
        capitalists and academics alike are inter-linked in a drive to
        technologize/computerize everything, with very little
        accountability to back them up.</p>
