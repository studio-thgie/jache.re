        colonialism, and why do global campaigners seek to “decolonize”
        it (see fig. 4.1)?” (<a

        p. 91</a>)</p>
        <p>Most people online are from the global south, and half of it
        are women. But most content was developed and produced by white
        men.</p>
        <p>The internet was and is structured by colonialism. Attempts
        to do better for the poorest and least connected often come from
        this perspective.</p>

        and that descriptive diversity reflects the many ways in which
        people experience the internet.” (<a
        href="zotero://select/library/items/93C54392">Philip, 2021,
        p. 93</a>)</p>
        <p>All the different views on the internet come from different
        professions and field and enlist different people and
        publics.</p>
        <p>The first maps of the internet drew “on visual discourses of
        identity and negated identity that echo those of the European
        maps of colonized and colonizable space of nearly a century
        ago.” (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/93C54392">Philip,
        2021, p. 95</a>)</p>
        <p>They were not accurate in how there was difference in
        connectivity and infrastructures. They ignored complex
        histories. This although cartography was already highly critical
        of being focused on nations.</p>

        to annotation</a>“Borrowing the term “metageography” from Lewis
        and Wigen, Harpold coined the term “internet metageographies.”
        He demonstrated how a variety of 1990s’ internet maps obscured
        transnational historical complexities, reified certain kinds of
        political hegemony, and reinscribed colonial tropes in popular
        network narratives.” (<a

        p. 96</a>)</p>
        <p>This maps of the internet reproduced colonial
        stereotypes.</p>
        <h3 id="tubes">Tubes</h3>
        <p>It’s important to remember the materiality of the internet.
        Even if you can make fun of the internet “as a series of tubes”,
        it’s still made of stuff and chained together. At the end of the
        20iest century, the virtuality of it all was the preferred
        image. Although comm. infrastructure looked like tubes for more
        than 150 years.</p>
        <p>The same was true for issues of race and gender, or the
        meatspace in other words. Another shift like this happened in
        measuring work as something in the fields, to something
        mental.</p>

        to annotation</a>“The promise of cyberspace in its most
        transcendent forms animated a range of Euro-American projects,
        from cyberpunk fiction to media studies. Virtuality was, of
        course, tied to cultures with robust infrastructures and high
        bandwidth.” (<a

        p. 100</a>)</p>
        <p>Neal Stephenson wrote about the undersea cables in 1996.
        Going against the grain of focusing on virtuality.</p>

        to annotation</a>“Known for the deep historical research he puts
        into his fiction writing, Stephenson ironically emulates the
        stylistics of early modern explorers, describing experiences
        among “exotic peoples” and “strange dialects.” All the cable
        workers we see are men, but they are depicted along a familiar
        nineteenth-century axis of masculinity.” (<a

        caged or lazy, the structure of the world map that recalls
        telegraph and cable maps, and the gendered metaphors of
        exploration and penetration are familiar to historians of
        empire.” (<a

        p. 102</a>)</p>
        <p>In the years to follow, infrastructure studies became popular
        in tech studies, anthropology and media studies.</p>

        Atlantic Ocean floor nor the rise of “infrastructure studies”
        yielded clean stories about matter untouched by politics. It
        seemed to be politics all the way down.” (<a

        p. 103</a>)</p>
        <p>After the 2000es and the dot-com boom, nations such as India,
        and other BRICS states, leapfroged their  developments and soon
        owned large parts of the global communication infrastructures.
        Brazil was soon to follow, after the NSA leaks in 2013. This
        brought a lot of skilled internet labour (sweatshops) to these
        countries but also a lot of expertise. And expertise which the
        western media couldn’t take up yet.</p>

        versus “virtual superstructure” split was morphing into debates
        over “rote/automatable tasks” versus “creative thinking.”” (<a

        p. 105</a>)</p>
        <p>This was for example displayed in a book by Daniel Pink, in
        which he calls for outsourcing of boring stuff to Asian, while
        keeping the interesting and creative work in the US.</p>

        Jacob Mathew finds that the internet is kept alive by a variety

        incorporating data dumps from the Border Gateway Protocol, which
        he calls “the Internet’s true routing table.”” (<a

        1990s. Its shift away from a defense and research backbone
        toward a public resource via the development of the World Wide
        Web is a military-corporate history that explains some of the
        confusion among media narratives. And technological freedom did
        not bring freedom from history and politics. The internet looks
        like a pipe in many places, but it moves along a radically
        branching structure and it is powered by human labor at all its
        exchange points. In the 1990s, internet narratives gave us a
        picture of a pipe constructed from colonial resources and
        bolstered by imperialist rhetoric, but, in more recent research,
        it appears to be uneven, radically branched, and maintained by a
        world of diverse people.” (<a
