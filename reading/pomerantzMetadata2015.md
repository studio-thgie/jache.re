[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G3PJA427?page=4&annotation=25MCUUHZ)“In the modern era of ubiquitous computing, metadata has become infrastructural, like the electrical grid or the highway system.” ([Pomerantz, 2015, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/GKXNNIHR))

The metadata object has it’s roots in the card catalogue, which was invented in France around the time of the French Revolution. The systems before that where clunky.

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G3PJA427?page=7&annotation=LYX58LFY)“Thus the catalog card is atomized along two dimensions: records for individual items, and categories of data shared by all items. And with that atomization along two dimensions, we arrive at databases, and the modern approach to metadata.” ([Pomerantz, 2015, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/GKXNNIHR))

-> everything is a database, if you’re brave enough

Metadata can be seen as a kind of map. [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G3PJA427?page=9&annotation=TQ964EN4)“Metadata is a means by which the complexity of an object is represented in a simpler form.” ([Pomerantz, 2015, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/GKXNNIHR))

Metadata helps us retrieve data, information, knowledge or things. This is called **resource discovery** in information science. In this, metadata usually tries to capture objective features of a thing. There are different types of metadata:

-   descriptive
-   administrative
-   structural
-   preservation
-   use

## Definitions

-   _metadata_: data about data
-   _data_: wisdom > knowledge > information > data

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G3PJA427?page=13&annotation=T3UTU7F2)“If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around, does it generate information?)” ([Pomerantz, 2015, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/GKXNNIHR))

-   _data_ is potential information; work is required to access it
-   books are _containers_ for data
-   _aboutness, description_: telling something about something
-   _subject analysis_: finding out what something is about

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G3PJA427?page=16&annotation=2KV4ISWV)“Metadata Is a Statement about a Potentially Informative Object” ([Pomerantz, 2015, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/GKXNNIHR))

-   _resource_: potentially informative object
-   _statement (triples)_: subject > predicate > object (Mona Lisa > creator > da Vinci)
-   _schema_: set of rules what statements are valid
-   _element-value pair_: ie creator: da Vinci

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/G3PJA427?page=18&annotation=5AXW9AYF)“What encoding schemes do is dictate how signifiers are constructed.” ([Pomerantz, 2015, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/GKXNNIHR))

-   _syntax encodings_ dictate format, ie yyyy-mm-dd
-   _controlled vocabularies_ limit the terms that can be used
-   _name authority_, ditto, but for names
-   _thesaurus_: defining the relations between words of a controlled vocabulary

    -   is a
    -   part of
    -   instance of
    -   part-whole
-   _uncontrolled vocabularies_: user tags…
-   _one-to-one_: one resource, one record
-   _one-to-one-to-one_: one resource, one record, one metadata schema
-   _internal metadata_: within the object, authoritative and static
-   _external metadata_: flexible but questionable
