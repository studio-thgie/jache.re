        manifestation was not to understand things in and of themselves
        but to understand how their variations within locations were an
        indication of a reformation—the alteration of some regional
        mode(s) of existence that mattered. And the purpose of
        understanding the tendencies, predilections, and orientations of
        any given part within a given formation was to keep that part
        oriented toward the given formation so that it could continue.
        Or, if one needed the formation to alter its perspective, the
        purpose was to lure, seduce, and “bait” a part of that world to
        reorient itself toward you in order to care for you. The
        alternative was that the world, as currently in sutu, turned
        away from your kind of existence and as a result you turned into
        another kind of existence. You become, not what you are not, but
        what you are in a different arrangement of existence.” (<a

        to annotation</a>“The answer to what a sudden, unexpected change
        in the arrangement of existence might mean depended on how much
        a person knew about things, the place, other things in the
        place, other places, et cetera. A manifestation might indicate
        an ongoing mutual orientation of existences (person, oyster,
        rock, wind, tide) in a place, a spurned orientation, or a mutual
        disorientation. But in all cases a manifestation was understood
        to be a sign that demanded to be heeded. Humans had to learn how
        to heed such manifestations, and they were assessed in their
        ability to provide cogent interpretations of them.” (<a

        important existences engaged in these practices of materializing
        attention. Binbin and Bilawag knew that other forms of existence
        were also constantly assessing them—the weight of their and my
        feet in the thin, slippery mud hiding the razor edges of oysters
        makes the point well enough.2 The mud, the oyster, and the
        weight of my body dynamically interpret each other in such a way
        that they produce a specific effect.” (<a

        indifferent world but an intensely interested one. By intensely
        interested, they meant that every region of the world was
        pressuring existing forms of existence and creating new ones—one
        specific form was the European settlers who wanted space and
        goods that could be transformed into market values and who
        claimed that Indigenous people were merely breathing fossils in
        the way of progress. Indigenous men and women could not be
        indifferent to these new forms of existence any more than they
        could be indifferent to manifestations like the durlgmö. What
        effect were these new forms of existence—settlers, cattle, pig,
        influenza, barbed wire—having on the given arrangement of their
        world? And how were other modes of existence in the landscape
        and the landscape itself reacting to these new modes and
        relations of existence? What were the manifestations that
        signaled these views and which ones should be heeded? As the

        certain manifestations or their lack even as feet pressed into
        mud, bent grass and branches, and followed pig, wallaby, and
        horse tracks. Visualization was a practice of the body in

        moving bodies. How one entered or exited a mangrove, a mud
        plain, a woodlands, or a house: these actions were broad sensory
        affects, cognitive imprints, and material indentations. The
        significance of Gracie Binbin and Betty Bilawag’s discovery of
        the durlgmö when they were younger women carries more weight
