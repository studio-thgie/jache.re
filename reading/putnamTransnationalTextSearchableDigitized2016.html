        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>This essay explores the consequences for historians’ research
        of the twinned transnational and digitized turns. The
        accelerating digitization of primary and secondary sources and
        the rise of full-text web-based search to access information
        within them has transformed historians’ research practice,
        radically diminishing the role of place-specific prior expertise
        as a prerequisite to discovery. Indeed, we can now find
        information without knowing where to look. This has incited
        remarkably little reflection among mainstream historians, but
        the consequences are profound. What has become newly possible?
        How do the new digital affordances relate to the current boom in
        transnational topics and approaches? How do the reach, speed,
        and granularity of digitized search impact our ability to
        reconstruct the supranational past? This essay heralds the novel
        forms of knowledge-generation made possible by technological
        transformations. It also attempts an accounting of all the
        ancillary learning that international research in an analog
        world once required. What kinds of knowledge and insight did
        place-based research across borders instill? What are the
        intellectual and political consequences of leaving that
        behind?</p>

        to annotation</a>“THE TRANSNATIONAL TURN IS accelerating
        simultaneously with the digital turn, and it is no coincidence.
        Source digitization has transformed historians’ practice in ways
        that facilitate border-crossing research in particular.
        Web-based full-text search decouples data from place. In doing
        so, it dissolves the structural constraints that kept history
        bound to political-territorial units long after the intellectual
        liabilities of that bond were well known. Digital search has
        become the unacknowledged handmaiden of transnational history.
        It is time to take stock of what that partnership enables—and
        what it obscures.” (<a
        href="zotero://select/library/items/C6F5M686">Putnam, 2016,
        p. 377</a>)</p>
        <p>“Ultimately, there is nothing inherently equalizing about the
        conjoined digitized and transnational turns. But one can hope.
        The changes in the information landscape that have lowered the
        barriers to international research by scholars from the Global
        North may increase their interest in the kinds of scholarly
        connection that can diffuse resources in new directions. Deep
        maps could provide new venues for international encounter and
        exchange. Virtual communication could lead to sustained
        collaboration. There could even be plane tickets. Putting
        scholars into new places for extended stays—including but not
        only from the Global South into the Global North and vice
        versa—has a great track record of building depth,
        contextualization, and geopolitical awareness. Digital research
        that carries us deeper into real-world connection may indeed
        create the border-crossing wisdom that our border-riven world
        needs.” (<a
