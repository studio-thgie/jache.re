## Notes

An anthropocentric critique of the zoo configurates them as places of spectacle, where human-over-animal dominance is fixated. It’s nonetheless a place of encounter and gazing each other.

The article starts with, that there is critical analysis of the zoo, but doesn’t state how this research or article relates to that.

-   [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TFEBJDDE?page=852&annotation=NRVWFK27)“surveillance as an instance of the power of care’” ([Rice et al., 2021, p. 852](zotero://select/library/items/MUB5H6B7)), as a reference to Foucault

This kind of surveillance is gaze-based, but can be equally applied through sound. An example would be beekeeping.

The absence of any criticality is striking. I’d be more then interested to know how listening practices relate to questions of power.

The zoo-keepers engage in monitory listening, which is a type of listening in, to check and know if everything is alright. It’s part of their habitus as keepers.

-   Absence of sound is also a sound
-   [Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TFEBJDDE?page=856&annotation=W4DSHVKN)“Drawing on Latourian notions of agency (e.g. Latour 1999: 180), animals can therefore be understood to participate in the mobilization and enactment of pastoral care, a point we explore in more detail below.” ([Rice et al., 2021, p. 856](zotero://select/library/items/MUB5H6B7))

I am in favor of acknowledging the agency of the zoos animals.

-   It is often humans, who are the most noisy animals

-   Animals do also listen in, as such having their own ecoustemology

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TFEBJDDE?page=864&annotation=undefined)“She can perhaps be said to have internalized the pastoral mission of the zoo and is, knowingly or not, at the edge of the production of a further disciplined subject.” ([Rice et al., 2021, p. 864](zotero://select/library/items/MUB5H6B7))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TFEBJDDE?page=865&annotation=6MQXI9D6)“In some contexts where humans are responsible for ensuring the well-being of nonhuman charges, care can be regarded as a mutual or even symbiotic practice” ([Rice et al., 2021, p. 865](zotero://select/library/items/MUB5H6B7))

is a pretty fucked up thing to state without considering the power dynamics at play
