        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>In this conversation transcript, Tom Rice asks Steve Feld a
        series of questions about ‘acoustemology’, a term Steve coined
        and which has become a key concept in sound studies. Referring
        to ‘acoustic epistemology’, a ‘knowing-with and knowing-through
        the audible’, acoustemology emerged in the context of Steve’s
        work on the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea and their intricate
        knowledge of the sounds of their rainforest environment (Feld
        2015, 12). It has since been applied by Steve, and many others,
        in studies of sound in a wide variety of settings. Tom asks
        questions that have arisen as he tries to explore and clarify
        the implications of the term. For instance, are acoustemologies
        invariably culturally embedded, or can they also be understood
        to emerge independently of culture? To what extent are
        acoustemologies shaped by individual and personal preferences,
        experiences and abilities? Is it possible for one acoustemology
        to end and another begin or do acoustemologies merely shift in
        terms of the sounds to which they are orientated? Answering with
        illustrations from his own intellectual journey, Steve presents
        acoustemology as an open-ended concept which is generative
        rather than prescriptive and which invites ongoing empirical
        research and interdisciplinary discussion.</p>

        relationship between acoustemology and culture, because I wonder
        to what extent, even hypothetically, you can have acoustemology
        independently of culture, and whether a way of knowing through
        sound isn’t something more fundamental, almost instinctive?” (<a

        from one another, if at all, in your mind?” (<a

        conceptualise in your own mind the acoustemological change that
        has happened? Do you feel that it is a question of loss of, say,
        the sonic way of knowing that you encountered in the 70s? Do you
        prefer to conceptualise it in terms of change or do you see it
        more as a layering: so one being built on another with an
        underlying constant? What is your preferred way of considering
        it?” (<a href="zotero://select/library/items/RP9JEJJA">Rice and

        “non-representational theory” and “more-than-representational
        theory” here? (e.g. Thrift 2007; Lorimer 2005). SF: Yes.
        Non-representational theory and also “affect theory”” (<a

        <p>Missing accountability seems to be baked in to his practice.
        See page 129 for more info.</p>
        <p>Multi-modality might not just democratize the way ethnography
        is produced, but also consumed. Thus, a critical reflection on
        this practice as well as how it makes research accessible must
        be present. It’s way easier to listen to a CD with “exotic”
        singers then reading a paper on it. It also makes context be
        lost easier.</p>
