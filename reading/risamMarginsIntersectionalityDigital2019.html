        <p>Intersectional questions pertain the field of digital
        humanities. Despite recognizing the need to be more inclusive,
        digital humanities are still white and male-dominated.</p>
        <p>I didn’t understand the problem behind theory versus
        practice.</p>

        integral to the digital humanities. Connections between the two

        <p>DH is prone to <a

        <p>A way to counter that is to <a

        <p>There is already a rich history of intersectional DH projects
        and research since at least the 2000ends. All with their own
        critiques and concerns.</p>

        p. 22</a>)</p>
        <p>DH is also prone to being monolithic, having the need to
        define itself and exclude those at the margins of it’s
        field.</p>

        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V9YNHICL?page=22&amp;annotation=NRMNTWB4">Go

        centre of digital humanities to understand the position of those
        whose work dwells in the peripheries, to understand the
        historical legacies that link knowledge production with the
        denigration—even the destruction—of that which is other.” (<a

        class, gender, and sexuality.” (Martha Nell Smith)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>“More recently, Smith has issued a call to integrate
        feminist, critical race, sexuality, and class-based analysis
        into digital humanities, particularly in digital archival
        practice. Such an approach would address questions like “How
        have these items of knowledge and the organizations and working
        groups who made them come into being? Who has stakes in their
        presentation? What is visible in these new media archives and
        what might not be? Can what is invisible but relevant be known
        to users of new digital archives?” (<a

        p. 22</a>)</p>
        <p>Because of priviledge and non-difference (all-whiteness), DH
        had the vibe of being super nice.</p>
        <p>“1. Let’s think about ways to build communities of
        underrepresented people … 2. Let’s acknowledge that we all do
        racist and sexist stuff sometimes … 3. Let’s talk about when our
        niceness could be shutting down important conversations … 4.
        Let’s believe people when they tell us they feel uncomfortable.”
        (Bianco, “This Digital Humanities.”)</p>

        href="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/V9YNHICL?page=24&amp;annotation=XEQLHDYG">Go
        to annotation</a>“As Bianco has suggested, computational
        scholarship already is “a radically heterogeneous and a
        multimodally layered—read, not visible—set of practices,
        constraints and codifications that operate below the level of
        user interaction.”56 In that layer, operations of
        intersectionality may be visible if we look for them.
        Accordingly, Bianco notes, “Our ethics, methods and theory are
        not transparent in our tools, unless you have the serious
        know-how to critically make them or hack them.”57 While digital
        humanists themselves may have access to that layer by virtue of
        technical skill, users engaging with digital humanities
        scholarship may not.” (<a

        <p>Intersectionality should be seen/used as tool/methodology
        itself within DH.</p>

        that shape a project visible even though they may not be readily
        understood.” (<a

        looking more closely at digital humanities projects, opening the
        black boxes to examine the imprints of intersectionality on
        archive, code, metadata, database, and more.” (<a
