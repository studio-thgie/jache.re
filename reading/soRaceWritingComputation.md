This preprocessing eliminates minor textual variations or elisions to allow for more matches” ([So et al., p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/JGSBAXHZ))

Such processes of removing information in order to make the corpus compareable very likely introduce adulterations into the texts. Have these ever been measured?
