        <p>title: “Review: Against Purity”</p>
        <hr />
        <p>Alexis Shotwell makes the case against purity in her book
        with the descriptive title “Against Purity: Living Ethically in
        Compromised Times”. This isn’t a book about trash - in her own
        words:</p>
        <pre><code>&quot;To be against purity is, again, not to be for pollution, harm, sickness, or premature death. It is to be against the rhetorical or conceptual attempt to delineate and delimit the world into something separable, disentangled, and homogenous.&quot;</code></pre>
        <p>Her point is, that the borders we draw to guard ourselves of
        the impure don’t uphold to reality - and that we’re better
        equiped for these times, if we see ourselves as being part of
        the impure.</p>
        <p>Against Purity is almost rythmically partitioned into Past,
        Present and Future. The timeframes are built upon each other and
        are themselves divided into two parts. The first on which she
        takes up one or two “problems” and the second, where she looks
        critically at projects that tackled those problems. Everything
        is held together nicely by explaining her train of thought and
        making the necessary links to other well established works. It
        makes up for a well written and accessible academic work.</p>
        <p>The themes that are taken up throughout the book (and stuck
        with me) are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>How post-colonial structures influence categories within
        abuse reparations for the aboriginals of canada.</li>
        <li>Memory practices in contemporary Canada around issues of
        postcoloniality and in the USA concerning the AIDS campaigns in
        the 1980s</li>
        <li>Gender-swapping frogs and transphobia</li>
        <li>Toxicity and the porousity of bodies</li>
        <li>Eating ideologies and morality</li>
        <li>Queer disability politics and gender issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The range of dealt topics is quite huge. They mostly circle
        around the concept and materiality of bodies, be it gender,
        toxicity or gender - but also how bodies are rooted in
        landscapes, environments or histories.</p>
        <p>There is a familiarity to “Staying with the Trouble” and “The
        Mushroom at the End of the World”. What Haray speculates and
        Tsing observes, Shotwel elaborates in thought. Together they
        form a holy trinity of contempary thought and work on being
        human without being human.</p>
        <p>I perceived Against Purity as most important input to turn a
        omni-present avoidism (moral and ethics based on what to avoid)
        into perceiveing “complexity and complicity as the constitutive
        situation of our lives”</p>
        <p>“Speculative futures can prefigure a practice that welcomes
        the selves to come. This orientation toward futures to come is
        grounded in the experience of interdependence, politically
        organized around the idea of identifying into a world that we
        create starting from our speculation that it could be otherwise
        than it is. Shaping our identities out of our politics includes
        understanding the history that has shaped our field of
        possibility as a site for identification. The new world we carry
        in our hearts is always a world grounded in the actually
        existing present in all its impurity, responsible to the past in
        all its complexity. Just as we are differentially responsible to
        the past and present, we are differentially situated in relation
        to worlds we can identify into—power never disappears. Even so,
        we can follow Muñoz in reaching toward concrete possibilities—a
        warm horizon imbued with possibility—prefiguratively practicing
        open normativities that might produce practices of freedom we
        cannot predict.”</p>
