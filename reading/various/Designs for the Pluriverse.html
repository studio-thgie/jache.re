        Pluriverse</h1>
        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>There is a difference between 1970 and Papaneks Design for
        the Real World and today. But designer today are following his
        call. This book is a politico-ontologic contribution. Design is
        everywhere and done by everyone. Especially ecology oriented
        fields see the importance of design. Design is to important to
        be left to designers.</p>
        <p><strong>From “Development” to the Pluriverse</strong></p>
        <p>The UN decided 1951 to throw the old ways overboard and
        created the category underdeveloped for the global south. It’s
        important to liberate and relocate design in the global south
        and its multiple onto-epistemic formations. Transition designers
        need to work together with those who protect and redefine
        relational and convivial autonomous communities from the
        south.</p>
        <p><strong>The Stakes</strong></p>
        <p>Can ‘they’ be stopped? Two takes on this question: Illich’s
        conviviality and radical feminists from South America and
        Europe. Technologies and specialized knowledge reached
        thresholds after which they became destructive. Illich proposed
        a radical turn, from industrial production to conviviality, to
        autonomous production and plural modes of production.</p>
        <p>Claudia von Werlhof locates the problem within patriarchy
        that destroys this earth to hold power over women and their
        ability to give life. Matriarchy as a relational mode of being.
        Patriarchical ways deprive of spirituality. There is a need for
        feminist politics that respects and builds on
        interconnectedness. Modernity isn’t helping really because it’s
        deeply entangled and produced by patriarchy. So we need to leave
        or radical transform modernity.</p>
        <p><strong>Design with/out futures</strong></p>
        <p>Can design be decoupled from modernity? Queremos un Mundo do
        de quepan muchos mundos (we want a world where many worlds fit).
        The activists of the global south came off age 1992 when they
        renamed south America as Abya Yala. Since then even more
        initiatives and movements formed a autonomous and communale
        base. These are processes of matriarchalization.</p>
        <p>Fry suggest transitioning to the Age of Sustainment and Dunne
        and Raby proposed critical, speculative design to counter the
        current future-less design. There is a spectrum between
        matriarchal and patriarchal (tech Posthuman) speculative
        fantasy. There is also the honest or intensified
        Auseinandersetzung with the aspect of the artificial.</p>
        <p><strong>The argument:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>A reflection on how to redesign design and move away from
        modernity</li>
        <li>Design is ontological but in the hands of patriarchy. An
        inquiry into I design that is relational.</li>
        <li>An outline on two different design theories. Autonomous
        design and design for transitions.</li>
        <li>A critical analyzes of design practices from contemporary
        Latin America epistemic and political experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Design for the real world</strong></p>
        <p>We live in a world surrounded and permeated by design. Design
        is everywhere, it’s a category beyond categories. But it also
        has been fully integrated into the neoliberal model of
        capitalism.</p>
        <p><strong>Designs arrival</strong></p>
        <p>There was a dialectic of wonder and disappointment,
        enthrallment and confusion, felt by the town’s people in
        response to so many modern inventions when design/technologies
        came to the undesigned communities. We in postmodern times don’t
        have that anymore. The story of Garcia Marquez and the authors
        are microethnographic examples of the complex entanglements of
        science, materials, technologies, capitalism and culture that
        make up the modern matrix of design. The second point is how
        design objects and practices make us who we are.</p>
        <p>(Design) Fairs are bringing about coloniality,
        classifications of people in terms of race and culture. So the
        history of design is much more than just designed objects.
        Design is an everyday aspect came with modernity because of the
        rise of expert knowledge and state bureaucracy. social norms for
        now designed by those two and not by communities from within or
        political processes at the local level. the question of what
        kind of world we wants to build is essential to ontologically
        oriented design. The question is, how can we find solutions
        quick enough and outside of the already existing comfortable
        epistemology?</p>
        <p>One path is to go from experts designing for the industry to
        human and environment centered design by the people.</p>
        <p><strong>Design as situated and interactive
        practice</strong></p>
        <p>There has been a shift in designing technology and the
        surrounding questions. Away from the early fascination with
        information tech to interaction design, in which tech is
        embodied, convival, conductive to care. This comes about from a
        new breed of design theorist, which can tackle wicked
        problems.</p>
        <p><strong>Architecture and Urbanism: Experimentation,
        Unsettlement, and the reinvention of the Vernacular</strong></p>
        <p>Three more areas need investigation to answer the question,
        if a critical design field is emerging: architecture, ecological
        design and design in politics. In architecture there is a tendon
        between design that helped to inflate design, like the
        architecture from Koolhaas and Gehry, and architecture which
        cares about a new kind of vernacular, like the half houses of
        Aravena. There are many indicators of a more human and ecology
        centered architecture, exemplified by the Venedig Biennale 2012.
        Juhani Pallasma said, that architecture now build houses, not
        homes. There is a poetry of home, which is lost and with it the
        ability to imagine alternative futures.</p>
