        <p>Staying with the Trouble: Making Kin in the Chthulucene
        (Experimental Futures) Donna J. Haraway</p>
        <p>Imagine a conference not on the Future of the Humanities in
        the Capitalist Restructuring University, but instead on the
        Power of the Humusities for a Habitable Multispecies Muddle!
        LOCATION: 860</p>
        <p>Arendt witnessed in Eichmann not an incomprehensible monster,
        but something much more terrifying—she saw commonplace
        thoughtlessness. That is, here was a human being unable to make
        present to himself what was absent, what was not himself, what
        the world in its sheer not-one-selfness is and what claims-to-be
        inhere in not-oneself. Here was someone who could not be a
        wayfarer, could not entangle, could not track the lines of
        living and dying, could not cultivate response-ability, could
        not make present to itself what it is doing, could not live in
        consequences or with consequence, could not compost. LOCATION:
        926</p>
        <p>Function mattered, duty mattered, but the world did not
        matter for Eichmann. The world does not matter in ordinary
        thoughtlessness. LOCATION: 930</p>
        <p>Mourning is about dwelling with a loss and so coming to
        appreciate what it means, how the world has changed, and how we
        must ourselves change and renew our relationships if we are to
        move forward from here. In this context, genuine mourning should
        open us into an awareness of our dependence on and relationships
        with those countless others being driven over the edge of
        extinction . . . The reality, however, is that there is no
        avoiding the necessity of the difficult cultural work of
        reflection and mourning. This work is not opposed to practical
        action, rather it is the foundation of any sustainable and
        informed response. LOCATION: 978</p>
        <p>Latour argues that we must learn to tell “Gaïa stories.” If
        that word is too hard, then we can call our narrations
        “geostories,” in which “all the former props and passive agents
        have become active without, for that, being part of a giant plot
        written by some overseeing entity.” LOCATION: 1021</p>
        <p>His Earthbound will have to trek into the Chthulucene to
        entangle with the ongoing, snaky, unheroic, tentacular, dreadful
        ones, the ones which/who craft material-semiotic netbags of
        little use in trials of strength but of great use in bringing
        home and sharing the means of living and dying well, perhaps
        even the means of ecological recuperation for human and
        more-than-human critters alike. LOCATION: 1072</p>
        <p>Anthropocene is a term most easily meaningful and usable by
        intellectuals in wealthy classes and regions; it is not an
        idiomatic term for climate, weather, land, care of country, or
        much else in great swathes of the world, especially but not only
        among indigenous peoples. LOCATION: 1189</p>
        <p>The Gorgons turned men who looked into their living,
        venomous, snake-encrusted faces into stone. I wonder what might
        have happened if those men had known how to politely greet the
        dreadful chthonic ones. I wonder if such manners can still be
        learned, if there is time to learn now, or if the stratigraphy
        of the rocks will only register the ends and end of a stony
        Anthropos. LOCATION: 1263</p>
        <p>Both the Anthropocene and the Capitalocene lend themselves
        too readily to cynicism, defeatism, and self-certain and
        self-fulfilling predictions, like the “game over, too late”
        discourse I hear all around me these days, in both expert and
        popular discourses, in which both technotheocratic
        geoengineering fixes and wallowing in despair seem to coinfect
        any possible common imagination. LOCATION: 1301</p>
        <p>“‘Do you realize,’ the phytolinguist will say to the
        aesthetic critic, ‘that [once upon a time] they couldn’t even
        read Eggplant?’ And they will smile at our ignorance, as they
        pick up their rucksacks and hike on up to read the newly
        deciphered lyrics of the lichen on the north face of Pike’s
        Peak.’” LOCATION: 1319</p>
        <p>To be animal is to become-with bacteria (and, no doubt,
        viruses and many other sorts of critters; a basic aspect of
        sympoiesis is its expandable set of players). LOCATION: 1469</p>
        <p>“Host-symbiont” seems an odd locution for what is happening;
        at whatever size, all the partners making up holobionts are
        symbionts to each other. LOCATION: 1495</p>
        <p>Hustak and Myers argue that a zero-sum game based on
        competing methodological individualists is a caricature of the
        sensuous, juicy, chemical, biological, material-semiotic, and
        science-making world. LOCATION: 1518</p>
        <p>intimacies and subtle propositions. What is at stake in this
        involutionary approach is a theory of ecological relationality
        that takes seriously organisms’ practices, their inventions, and
        experiments crafting interspecies lives and worlds. This is an
        ecology inspired by a feminist ethic of “response-ability” . . .
        in which questions of species difference are always conjugated
        with attentions to affect, entanglement, and rupture; an
        affective ecology in which creativity and curiosity characterize
        the experimental forms of life of all kinds of practitioners,
        not only the humans. LOCATION: 1524</p>
        <p>Rather, the crafters stitch “intimacy without proximity,” a
        presence without disturbing the critters that animate the
        project, but with the potential for being part of work and play
        for confronting the exterminationist, trashy, greedy practices
        of global industrial economies and cultures.53 Intimacy without
        proximity is not “virtual” presence; it is “real” presence, but
        in loopy materialities. The abstractions of the mathematics of
        crocheting are a kind of lure to an affective cognitive ecology
        stitched in fiber arts. The crochet reef is a practice of caring
        without the neediness of touching by camera or hand in yet
        another voyage of discovery. LOCATION: 1722</p>
        <p>Working with Brazilian Amerindian hunters, with whom he
        learned to theorize the radical conceptual realignment he called
        multinaturalism and perspectivism, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro
        wrote, “Animism is the only sensible version of materialism.”
        LOCATION: 1862</p>
        <p>I am talking about material semiotics, about practices of
        worlding, about sympoiesis that is not only symbiogenetic, but
        is always a sensible materialism. The sensible materialisms of
        involutionary momentum are much more innovative than secular
        modernisms will allow. Stories for living in the Chthulucene
        demand a certain suspension of ontologies and epistemologies,
        holding them lightly, in favor of more venturesome, experimental
        natural histories. LOCATION: 1867</p>
        <p>symanimagenic sensible materialism, LOCATION: 1870</p>
        <p>Hózhó is a central concept in Navajo cosmology and daily
        practice. Usual translations into English are “beauty,”
        “harmony,” and “order”; but I think a better translation would
        emphasize right relations of the world, including human and
        nonhuman beings, who are of the world as its storied and dynamic
        substance, not in the world as a container. LOCATION: 1902</p>
        <p>Weaving is neither secular nor religious; it is sensible. It
        performs and manifests the meaningful lived connections for
        sustaining kinship, behavior, relational action—for hózhó—for
        humans and nonhumans. Situated worlding is ongoing, neither
        traditional nor modern. LOCATION: 1916</p>
        <p>We relate, know, think, world, and tell stories through and
        with other stories, worlds, knowledges, thinkings, yearnings. So
        do all the other critters of Terra, in all our bumptious
        diversity and category-breaking speciations and knottings. Other
        words for this might be materialism, evolution, ecology,
        sympoiesis, history, situated knowledges, cosmological
        performance, science art worldings, or animism, complete with
        all the contaminations and infections conjured by each of these
        terms. Critters are at stake in each other in every mixing and
        turning of the terran compost pile. We are compost, not
        posthuman; we inhabit the humusities, not the humanities.
        Philosophically and materially, I am a compostist, not a
        posthumanist. Critters—human and not—become-with each other,
        compose and decompose each other, in every scale and register of
        time and stuff in sympoietic tangling, in ecological
        evolutionary developmental earthly worlding and unworlding.
        LOCATION: 2039</p>
        <p>I think our job is to make the Anthropocene as short/thin as
        possible and to cultivate with each other in every way
        imaginable epochs to come that can replenish refuge. LOCATION:
        2089</p>
        <p>All the thousand names are too big and too small; all the
        stories are too big and too small. As Jim Clifford taught me, we
        need stories (and theories) that are just big enough to gather
        up the complexities and keep the edges open and greedy for
        surprising new and old connections. LOCATION: 2106</p>
        <p>I propose “Make Kin Not Babies!” Making—and recognizing—kin
        is perhaps the hardest and most urgent part.12 Feminists of our
        time have been leaders in unraveling the supposed natural
        necessity of ties between sex and gender, race and sex, race and
        nation, class and race, gender and morphology, sex and
        reproduction, and reproduction and composing persons (our debts
        here are due especially to Melanesians, in alliance with Marilyn
        Strathern and her ethnographer kin).13 If there is to be
        multispecies ecojustice, which can also embrace diverse human
        people, it is high time that feminists exercise leadership in
        imagination, theory, and action to unravel the ties of both
        genealogy and kin, and kin and species. LOCATION: 2120</p>
        <p>It matters how kin generate kin. LOCATION: 2150</p>
        <p>Shame is a prod to lifelong rethinking and recrafting one’s
        accountabilities! LOCATION: 2301</p>
        <p>but the details matter. The details link actual beings to
        actual response-abilities. Each time a story helps me remember
        what I thought I knew, or introduces me to new knowledge, a
        muscle critical for caring about flourishing gets some aerobic
        exercise. LOCATION: 2394</p>
        <p>Giving my dog DES makes me accountable to histories and
        ongoing possibilities differently than if we never shaped
        kinships with the attachment sites of this molecule. Perhaps
        reading this chapter has consequences for response-ability too.
        We are all responsible to and for shaping conditions for
        multispecies flourishing in the face of terrible histories, but
        not in the same ways. The differences matter—in ecologies,
        economies, species, lives. LOCATION: 2400</p>

        critic, “that they couldn’t even read Eggplant?” And they will
        smile at our ignorance, as they pick up their rucksacks and hike
        on up to read the newly deciphered lyrics of the lichen on the
        north face of Pike’s Peak. —Ursula K. Le Guin, “The Author of
        the Acacia Seeds” LOCATION: 2406</p>

        <p>Her kind of thinking enlarges, even invents, the competencies
        of all the players, including herself, such that the domain of
        ways of being and knowing dilates, expands, adds both
        ontological and epistemological possibilities, proposes and
        enacts what was not there before. LOCATION: 2593</p>

        <p>Hannah Arendt and Virginia Woolf both understood the high
        stakes of training the mind and imagination to go visiting, to
        venture off the beaten path to meet unexpected, non-natal kin,
        and to strike up conversations, to pose and respond to
        interesting questions, to propose together something
        unanticipated, to take up the unasked-for obligations of having
        met. LOCATION: 2671</p>
        <p>Anna Tsing urges us to cobble together the “arts of living on
        a damaged planet”; and among those arts are cultivating the
        capacity to reimagine wealth, learn practical healing rather
        than wholeness, and stitch together improbable collaborations
        without worrying overmuch about conventional ontological kinds.

        <p>Compostists eagerly found out everything they could about
        experimental, intentional, utopian, dystopian, and revolutionary
        communities and movements across times and places. One of their
        great disappointments in these accounts was that so many started
        from the premises of starting over and beginning anew, instead
        of learning to inherit without denial and stay with the trouble
        of damaged worlds. LOCATION: 3032</p>
        <p>Camille 2 had to learn to let go of colonialist notions of
        religion and secularism to begin to appreciate the sheer
        semiotic materiality of those who came before. Until sympoiesis
        with the dead could be acknowledged, sympoiesis with the living
        was radically incomplete. LOCATION: 3157</p>
