        <p>The Mushroom at the End of the World On the Possibility of
        Life in Capitalist Ruins Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing</p>
        <p>“[…] interspecies encounters are always events, “things that
        happen,” the units of history.”</p>
        <p>“Brown’s political listening […] suggests that any gathering
        contains many inchoate political futures and that political work
        consists of helping some of those come into being.”</p>
        <p>This two short sentences capture the spirit of the book much
        more then it’s subtitle does. I found the focus on capitalism,
        as I find capitalism quite frankly, utterly boring. Don’t get me
        wrong. I don’t think pondering upon capitalism is futile or
        stupid. I’m just not into it that much. Capitalism, for me, is
        one of many contingent ways of organizing exchange.</p>
        <p>This book, certainly is not about capitalism.</p>
        <p>The alleged center or starting point for Lowenhaupt Tsing is
        salvage capitalism. Salvage Capitalism moves in, takes what this
        planet has to offer, from wood to oil, and produces alienated
        goods from that to feed itself. What’s left over are capitalist
        ruins. These just so happen to be the ideal milieu, disturbed
        middle age pine forrest, for Japan’s most precious mushroom -
        the matsutake. And this is where the real trip begins - from
        Japan to Oregon with stops in China and the Vietnam War - and
        along the way we tackle all kinds of wonderful stories and
        concepts.</p>
        <p>Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing has a talent in effortlessly mixing up
        many disciplines, micro and macro views of events, different
        cultures and more. She is able to pull it off because the
        patchiness / assemblage / entanglement within her favorite
        subject, the mushroom, has found it’s way into her
        storytelling.</p>
        <p>“Unlike most scholarly books, what follows is a riot of short
        chapters. I wanted them to be like the flushes of mushrooms that
        come up after a rain: an over-the-top bounty; a temptation to
        explore; an always too many. The chapters build an open-ended
        assemblage, not a logical machine; they gesture to the
        so-much-more out there. They tangle with and interrupt each
        other - mimicking the patchiness of the world I am trying to
        describe.”</p>
        <p>She succeeds in doing so.</p>
        <p>Instead of a critical analysis of contemporary capitalism,
        what we get is a panopticum of a hidden trade which involves the
        whole world, sprinkled with some poetics in between. While the
        book is very well written, good researched and easy to follow,
        it was more the experience of reading the book that did it for
        me. There is something about the book, some quality hidden from
        plain sight, but still, it’s there.</p>
        <p>“The sound of the temple bell is heard in the cedar forest at
        dusk. The autumn aroma drifts on the roads below.” Akemi
        Tachibana (1812 - 1868)</p>
        <p>Besides a marvelous insight into the global trade of
        matsutake, it’s polito-economical, ecological and societal
        aspects and all the individual fates interwoven in that process
        there are two themes I would like to point out.</p>
        <p>Latent Commons</p>
        <p>The concept of latent commons emerge like a sudden flush of
        mushrooms in the book. Compared to the usual pace of the book,
        this feels quite brutal.</p>
        <p>“I search for fugitive moments of entanglement in the midst
        of institutionalized alienation. These are sites in which to
        seek allies. One might think of them as latent commons. They are
        latent in two senses: first, while ubiquitous, we rarely notice
        them, and, second, they are undeveloped.”</p>
        <p>In it’s dense state those few words she loses after those
        initial sentences mimick a manifesto. Latent commons are not
        human only. They include all what is - pests and diseases.
        Latent commons are a kind of collaboration. They don’t
        instituionalize well. They cannot redeem us.</p>
        <p>These mere 300 words are something to come back to and let it
        linger some more. In it’s core it points to the mushrooms as a
        latent common, something we all can go out and pick and which is
        hidden at the momement. In it’s wider meaning, it resembles the
        T.A.Z. - a condensation in time-space in which something out of
        the ordinary happens.</p>
        <p>Listening</p>
        <p>Rhizomatic woven throughout the whole book are the arts of
        noticing, arts of listening. There is some odd buddhistic
        quality about this. But the awareness needed to find the
        mushrooms must undeniably lead to arts of noticing. The
        mushrooms are often hidden from plain sight under just a little
        budge in the ground. In other instances, one must be able to
        read the environment to determine it’s imidiate history. Were
        deers around here and can they lead us to a fresh patch? Or did
        somebody else allready get all the goods?</p>
        <p>For Lowenhaupt Tsing, the arts of noticing are about reading
        potentials.</p>
        <p>“This kind of noticing is just what is needed to appreciate
        the multiple temporal rhythms and trajectories of the
        assemblage.” And “It suggests that any gathering contains many
        inchoate political futures and that political work consists of
        helping some of those come into being.”</p>
        <p>We humans have five major senses and some minor ones. The
        roots of a plant can have around fifteen major senses.
        Assemblages of plants and mushrooms are amazing feats of
        collaboration. They are producing plant-mushroom-knowledge to
        work with the given surroundings. Arts of noticing, in this
        context, is acknowledging what is, beyond seeing and beyond
        quantifing.</p>
        <p>The Mushroom at the End of the World is a posthuman book, but
        one emerging from praxis. It misses all the complicated lingo
        and concepts. It misses they historical temporality of the
        humanities. Pleas read it.<strong><em>END OF

        open ended gatherings</p>
        <p>political listening</p>
        <p>Now what? Brown’s political listening addresses this. It
        suggests that any gathering contains many inchoate political
        futures and that political work consists of helping some of
        those come into being. Indeterminacy is not the end of history
        but rather that node in which many beginnings lie in wait. To
        listen politically is to detect the traces of
        not-yet-articulated common agendas. When we take this form of
        awareness out of formal meetings into everyday life, yet more
        challenges appear. How, for example, shall we make common cause
        with other living beings? Listening is no longer enough; other
        forms of awareness will have to kick in. And what great
        differences yawn! Like Brown, I would acknowledge difference,
        refusing to paper it over with good intentions. Yet we cannot
        rely on expert spokesmen, as we have learned in human politics.
        We need many kinds of alertness to spot potential allies. Worse
        yet, the hints of common agendas we detect are undeveloped,
        thin, spotty, and unstable. At best we are looking for a most
        ephemeral glimmer. But, living with indeterminacy, such glimmers
        are the political.</p>
        <p>polyphonic music</p>
        <p>When I first learned polyphony, it was a revelation in
        listening; I was forced to pick out separate, simultaneous
        melodies and to listen for the moments of harmony and dissonance
        they created together. This kind of noticing is just what is
        needed to appreciate the multiple temporal rhythms and
        trajectories of the assemblage.</p>
