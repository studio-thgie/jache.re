        <li>page 1:
        <ul>
        <li>what are the issues of “openness” and “accessibility”?</li>
        <li>how are the two aims correlating? why the need to do
        both?</li>
        <li>maybe introduce FAIR ORD abbreviation</li>
        <li>maybe have a brief look at FAIR/CARE, the care part is quite
        powerful and certainly goes into the direction of this projects
        aims. fair is more about technical aspects, care is about the
        ethics and socio-technical dimensions -
        https://www.gida-global.org/care</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 2
        <ul>
        <li>susan leigh star is always a nice addition to any
        infrastructural approaches :) (especially in the digital
        humanities)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 4
        <ul>
        <li>2.1 Current state of research in the field reads quite
        strongly and is very precise, I skipped it in parts</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 8/9
        <ul>
        <li>if you talk about openness, access and audiences, please be
        specific who these audiences are and what this access entails.
        maybe I missed it (overread it), in my limited opinion access
        needs very specific aims (ie being readable by people with
        limited sight or being better discoverable by students in the
        arts). otherwise consider a universal design approach. simply
        catering to critical artist researchers would be limiting the
        potential of such a project.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 9
        <ul>
        <li>2.2 Current state of own research reads as it should,
        nothing to add here :) skipped it in parts</li>
        <li>first paragraph, line 4: Theit goal</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 12
        <ul>
        <li>a thing i personally always enjoy is when the main questions
        are assigned to the roles and WPs through some signifiers (ie Q1
        or whatever). it weaves the roles, wps and questions
        together.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 13
        <ul>
        <li>replace checksum verification by checking the integrity of
        the digital material</li>
        <li>WP1: how will you deal with extremely difficult material, ie
        the display of traumatic experiences</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 14
        <ul>
        <li>since you considerably change the archive, is there a plan
        to preserve the as-is state for later research (with different
        methods and tools of different capabilities)?</li>
        <li>how will you deal with limited ressources, ie what if you
        can only analyse and work through a subset?</li>
        <li>maybe move the questions to the main question part</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 15
        <ul>
        <li>Following a comparison between these oral accounts and the
        analysis of available archival material - how will the
        comparison be made</li>
        <li>WP3: an expanded understanding of interface could be
        benefitial. Interface not only as user (graphical) interface,
        but as the “thing” between the participant and the archive.
        Having the Digitalisate in wikibase and the DaSCH repositories
        enables the consumation through application interfaces. An
        interface is also the way a user is enabled to act within the
        designed environment. In a socio-cultural network the ethics
        towards openess and access become part of the interface. A
        curb-cut is an interface to the sidewalk.</li>
        <li>I’m fairly content with the methodological approach of
        development :D Iterative, testing, and partners!</li>
        <li>I’d say it’s important to state that WP3 is of equal
        importance (and not just “designing the UI”) as this is the
        place where research findings of openess and access in the arts
        are translated from theory into practice</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 18
        <ul>
        <li>a bit special in my case: I’m always very interested how
        interdisciplinary collaboration is looking like in practice. how
        are you forstering openess and access in-team? others for
        example have specific retreats or other encounter-based rituals
        (interfaces?) in their schedule, in order to make team-members
        be able to take the time to translate their own’s discipline
        discourses and epistemologies into other. Or, at least, to let
        the others participate in one’s own domain/discipline. I
        understand interdisciplinary as a participatory approach that
        needs active mediation.</li>
        <li>I feel that the latter 2/3 of the first paragraph belong to
        state of own research. risk should be met with a methodological
        approach. that the team is able to meet the risks based on their
        backgrounds is a given I guess?</li>
        <li>maybe summarize the risks again to give a quick overview and
        then point to the longer descriptions in their respective
        contexts</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>page 19
        <ul>
        <li>“There is a lack of shared discussions around topics of
        openness and accessibility between researchers,
        <strong>artists</strong> and service provides.” ? maybe put the
        “clients” in their as well</li>
        <li>2.5 Relevance: The interface of WP3 isn’t specifically
        mentioned. I have the feeling it should be referenced here again
        in order to justify it being in the funding application</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul>
