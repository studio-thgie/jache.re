        <p>Algorithmic regulation would essentially introduce hunter - prey evolution. Also it’s about thresholds. Laws are black and white with possibilities of interpretation. A mail might or might not be spam. Nobody knows. Such a complex system could evolve very fast until we don’t understand it anymore - like high speed stock trading. It should be about less regulation, not more. But also not in the libertarian sense. More like simplification. There are also pretty solid studies that the rating economy is very inaccurate. Also ultrastable is pretty boring. Like democracy but worse.</p>
