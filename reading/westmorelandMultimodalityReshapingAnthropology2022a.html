        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>Multimodality offers anthropologists an inflection on the way
        we do research, produce scholarship, teach students, and relate
        to diverse publics. Advancing an expanding array of tools,
        practices, and concepts, multimodality signals a change in the
        way we pay attention and attend to the diverse possibilities for
        understanding the human experience. Multimodality recognizes the
        way smartphones, social media, and digital software transform
        research dynamics in unprecedented ways, while also drawing upon
        longstanding practices of recording and presenting research
        through images, sounds, objects, and text. Rather than flatten
        out ethnographic participant observation into logocentric
        practices of people-writing, multimodal ethnographies diversify
        their modes of inquiry to produce more-than-textual mediations
        of sensorial research experiences. By emphasizing kaleidoscopic
        qualities that give shape to an emergent, multidimensional, and
        diversifying anthropology, multimodality proposes alternatives
        to enduring and delimiting dichotomies, particularly text/image.
        These new configurations invite unrealized disciplinary
        constellations and research collaborations to emerge, but also
        require overhauling the infrastructures that support training,
        dissemination, and assessment.</p>

        <h3 id="expanded-sensorium">Expanded Sensorium</h3>
        <p>Multimodality wants to use the whole of the researchers body
        as investigative instrument. Tho, vision has troublesome
        aspects. For example as <em>colonial gaze</em>, where it served
        for positivist evidence of racial hierarchies. One approach
        positions sights as something to be learned, and states that
        most ethnographers are not very good trained at seeing.</p>

        <p>A lot of effort went into reflecting on practices of using
        visuals for ethnographic research. Other senses did not enjoy
        that much energy put into them.</p>
        <h3 id="reflexive-immediacy">Reflexive Im/mediacy</h3>
        <p>Whereas anthropology in the 19th century happen mostly
        through second-hand research, todays technologies support an
        immediacy. Multimodality, analogue to Drucker, sees data not as
        a objective given thing, but as a capta, generated by the
        researcher. Multimodality also means, as the senses are always
        entangled, media are also always intermixed.</p>

        introduced from external frameworks, the term helps
        anthropologists address an array of contradictions inherent in
        the ethnographic enterprise. By infinitely expanding the forms
        of ethnography, multimodality challenges the primacy of textual
        representation without abandoning the many articulations of
        voice. By attuning an expanded sensorium to specific research
        contexts, multimodality challenges the assumptions about
        observational clarity without dismissing the multifaceted and
        embodied ways of seeing. By reflexively recognizing the
        indeterminant additive qualities of mediation, multimodality
        challenges the authenticity of immediacy without denying the
        technocentric shadow cast across our research pathways.” (<a

        <p>There seems to be two different streams of development in
        visual anthropology. On is about institutionalizing and the
        other is dissidenting, crossing borders to art practice. The
        later saw visual anthropolgy as a field in it’s own right, with
        it’s own way of knowing. They proposed three principles</p>

        “the distinctive expressive structures” of audiovisual media,
        rather than approaches derived from verbal or quantitative modes
        of inquiry; (b) epistemological frameworks open to more
        perceptual and affective forms of knowledge, rather than
        propositional and logical principles; and (c) conceptual
        frameworks engaged with topographical, temporal, corporeal, and
        personal aspects of human experience.” (<a

        multimodalists have prioritized alternative ways of knowing,
        decolonizing the discipline, reconfiguring research and peer
        relationships, imagining the ontological otherwise, and giving
