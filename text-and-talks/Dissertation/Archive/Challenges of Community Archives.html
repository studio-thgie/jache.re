        <p>As the term “community archive” has gained popularity, it has
        been applied in a variety of ways, including as a way to denote
        community participation in knowledge creation and preservation
        in ways that may challenge existing dominant historical and
        political narratives.<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Community_archives&amp;oldid=1084521115#cite_note-11">[11]</a><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Community_archives&amp;oldid=1084521115#cite_note-12">[12]</a>
        However, the ambiguity inherent in defining the terms “<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community"
        title="Community">community</a>” and “<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive"
        title="Archive">archives</a>” complicates attempts to discuss
        and define what is meant by “community archives”. Therefore,
        allowing these independent entities to label and define their
        organizations and missions is one important way to support their
        activities.<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Community_archives&amp;oldid=1084521115#cite_note-whose-3">[3]</a></p>
        <p>Whether community archives consider their endeavors to be
        political, exerting control over community documentation and
        storytelling inherently calls attention to issues of power
        manifest in traditional approaches to archival creation and
        maintenance.<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Community_archives&amp;oldid=1084521115#cite_note-whose-3">[3]</a>
        As the interest in, and number of, community archives increase
        globally, opportunities to document and share these efforts and
        materials with the general public may result in tension between
        community archives stakeholders and heritage professionals who
        are trained with an emphasis on legal, intellectual, and
        physical control of records.<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Community_archives&amp;oldid=1084521115#cite_note-whose-3">[3]</a></p>
        <p>Since many community archives develop as independent social
        spaces, often distinct from mainstream narratives, their
        organizational champions may resist archival labels and/or
        intervention by trained professionals out of concern that
        collections may be absorbed by formal institutions and rendered
        inaccessible to their communities. Therefore, issues of
        independence and autonomy tend to be at the forefront of
        community archival identities, even if they seek partnerships or
        welcome support from traditional cultural heritage
        institutions.<a

        <p>This is not the only model for archival practice. Community
        groups should also be empowered to develop their own archives. 
        As <a
        href="http://roadside.org/news/five-misconceptions-about-documentation-archiving-and-communication-field-community-cultura">Jamie
        Haft</a>argues, lines should not be drawn between
        “community-based” and “academic,” or “amateur” and
        “professional.” Rather, archives – as a practice and as
        construct – can be understood on a continuum of practice between
        the producers of the content and the preservers.</p>
        <p>The <a
        href="http://www.lesbianherstoryarchives.org/history.html">Lesbian
        Herstory Archives</a> exemplifies the success of a
        community-based archive in which the community defines these
        practices. In this case, the community defines the way the
        materials in the archive are preserved, represented, and
        accessed.  While professional archival standards may inform the
        practices in these organizations, communities often establish
        their own standards based on their philosophies and values.</p>

        <p>“Many professional archivists and funders questioned whether
        a digital-only repository could take preservation issues
        seriously.”  She also explains that some questioned whether an
        independent community-based organization could sustainably
        steward materials, while others claimed the project would not be
        of interest to a wider audience.  But more than a decade on, the
        field has shifted.  “Along with an increased awareness of the
        labor, expertise, and infrastructure needed to sustain and
        preserve digital materials, there is respect for the work of
        community archives, and a greater appreciation of the value of
        the histories of communities of color in the US,” says
        Caswell.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as collections expand, so does the need to implement
        best practices and invest in infrastructure like
        climate-controlled storage and research facilities that can
        accommodate access by a growing number of users.</p>
        <p>“It’s incredibly significant for a marginalized group to have
        evidence that their community has been around a long time,” says
        Michelle Caswell.  “The emotional impact of seeing yourself
        existing across space and time is profound.”</p>
