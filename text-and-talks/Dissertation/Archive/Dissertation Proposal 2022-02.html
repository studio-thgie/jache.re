        <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
        <p>The infrastructure of an archive manifests its participatory
        ontology and shapes the possibility space for epistemological
        practices. This research proposal wants to look at the
        development of a digital image archive from an infrastructural
        point of view and inquire how design decisions and technical
        implementations on that level influence its participatory
        character. The focus of this work is the inquiry into the
        imaginaries and models of communal managed data, which is
        regarded as the core materiality of a digital archive.</p>
        <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
        <p>This research proposal relates to the subproject B2.3, which
        is the software development for the implementation of the user
        interface and is adapted for in order for this proposal to fit
        my own profile. The scope of B2.3 has expanded to the point,
        that the development includes the full stack of technologies
        necessary to run a digital archival platform. Initially, only
        the implementation of the frontend was considered, but I am by
        now in charge of or involved in all levels of conception and
        technical implementation. As such, this proposal relates to the
        issues and goals of the parent research project
        <em>Participatory Knowledge Practices in Analogue and Digital
        Image Archives (PIA)</em><a href="/text-and-talks/Dissertation/Archive/Dissertation Proposal 2022-02.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Archival infrastructures enable and regulate the flow of
        resources, archival material, and knowledge between several
        actors, some of which can be positioned inside of the archival
        infrastructure and some of which are located on the outside.</p>
        <p>In PIA, we inquire about the participatory potentials of
        digital image archives in comparison to their analog versions,
        and how to expand on that potential where present. As of now,
        this inquiry happens mainly on the level of the content of the
        archive and in the interplay between different human actants who
        pandare interested in engaging with that material. The reasons
        for this interest can differ and be initiated by either from
        within the archive or actants outside the archive.</p>
        <p>Participatory approaches depend on the distinguishing of an
        inside and an outside. Inside are human actants who are
        considered <em>experts</em> on archival practices as well as the
        content of the archive. The people on the outside need further
        specification, but generally is consituted by an interested
        public. These <em>amateurs</em>, which may or may not be
        <em>experts</em>, are characterized by their engagement with the
        material, or the archive itself.</p>
        <p>Derrida made a similar observation when he noted that
        archives need certain exteriority, an outside.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“As “[t]here is no archive without a place of consignation,
        without a technique of repetition, and without a certain
        exteriority”, there is “[n]o archive without outside”” <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="sieberPoliticsArchivesMedia2016">[@sieberPoliticsArchivesMedia2016,
        p. 27]</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In his analysis he refers to the localization of the archive,
        pointing towards its materiality. Not explicitly mentioned but
        included is the social outside. Human actants which are not part
        of the archives many processes but who help sustain it, for
        example through financing it, delivering material, or enriching
        the existing.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“Already in the ancient residences of superior magistrates
        filing official documents, archives, according to Derrida,
        “needed at once a guardian and a localization”, and thus “could
        neither do without substrate nor without residence”. Archives
        therefore “take place in a domiciliation”, and their ‘documents’
        are “only kept and classified under the title of the archive by
        virtue of a privileged topology”” <span class="citation"
        data-cites="sieberPoliticsArchivesMedia2016">[@sieberPoliticsArchivesMedia2016,
        p. 26]</span></p>
        </blockquote>

        <li>something about community</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each archive has its focus, materialities as well as
        preservation strategies. Generally seen, the infrastructure of
        an archive becomes the place that enables archival and research
        practices. I work with the term or concept of infrastructure as
        outlined and championed by Susan Leigh Star and Brian Larkin.
        <span class="citation"

        @larkinPoliticsPoeticsInfrastructure2013]</span>. Infrastructure
        then becomes a socio-material assemblage <span class="citation"
        data-cites="rippaInfrastructureArchiveArchiving2020">[@rippaInfrastructureArchiveArchiving2020]</span>
        that reaches farther than its mere technicalities.
        Infrastructure is not just the server on which images are
        archived, but also the technical and visual interfaces through
        which these can be accessed, the protocols and standards that
        regulate exchange, and the user and role management in place
        which dictate who is an expert, and who is a citizen
        scientist.</p>
        <p>The Software Heritage foundation considers software as its
        epistemology, whereas source code is the only human-readable
        version of software <span class="citation"
        data-cites="dicosmoSoftwareHeritageWhy2017">[@dicosmoSoftwareHeritageWhy2017]</span>.
        Archival software then becomes the manifestation of knowledge on
        how the former mentioned infrastructural relationships are
        instantiated. Being of digital matter, archival software has a
        specific potential for participatory approaches within the
        context of development with far-reaching consequences on the
        levels of participation on the level of content and archival and
        research practices<a href="/text-and-talks/Dissertation/Archive/Dissertation Proposal 2022-02.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
        id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>Looking at archives from an infrastructural point of view, we
        can see that decisions on that level shape the space of
        possibilities in the interaction with the users. Nick Seaver, an
        anthropologist of socio-technological matters, studied the
        development of music recommendation systems. He observed how the
        developer’s perception of the user of these systems shaped the
        infrastructure, which in turn marred the space of participation
        within the system <span class="citation"
        data-cites="seaverSeeingInfrastructureAvidity2021">[@seaverSeeingInfrastructureAvidity2021]</span>.
        The users became visible to the system only through desirable
        data points.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“But infrastructures also exist as forms separate from their
        purely technical functioning, and they need to be analyzed as
        concrete semiotic and aesthetic vehicles oriented to addressees.
        They emerge out of and store within them forms of desire and
        fantasy and can take on fetish-like aspects that sometimes can
        be wholly autonomous from their technical function.” <span

        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="problems-and-general-questions">Problems and general
        questions</h2>
        <p>Interesting in this context is the comparison to public
        libraries, which have similar epistemological functions, but a
        different approach towards the public, the outside. Libraries,
        says Shannon Mattern, “are designed through really robust
        programs of civic engagement”, and “that [the] really diverse
        local community is often invited into the design process” <span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="ShannonMattern2022">[@ShannonMattern2022]</span>.
        The outcome of those processes is often, that the community
        feels a sense of ownership in this particular place.</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Due to the scope of the project as well as this research
        proposal, the infrastructure of the digital image archive must
        be inquired through a specific lense. I suggest to use
        <em>data</em> as a boundary object as it is most fitting to my
        own profile as interface between digital humanities, design and
        as a service provider to the team of cultural anthropology.</p>
        <p>Within the infrastructure of a digital archive, data becomes
        a boundary object between the many actants that partake in
        archival activities. It draws a transversal line from the
        outside to the inside, and back again. What are participatory
        imaginaries for data within the context of a digital image
        archive, such as data commons or data trusts?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>What are communal models and imaginaries of data management
        that favour participatition within a digital image archive?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="research-design">Research Design</h2>
        <p>For this research proposal, the following aspects of
        infrastructure can be identified, but not all of them can/will
        be considered. They are providing the anchor points of the
        transversal points of constituting, transforming, storing and
        generally working on data.</p>

        consitute the data landscape/environment of the digital image

        <p>How the infrastructure, the software, and its technological
        ecosystem, are conceived, considered, and implemented influences
        and is influenced by every other approach within PIA. As such,
        the base for this research proposal needs an ongoing analysis of
        all actants and their ontologies through actor-network
        theory.</p>
        <p>Such an analysis will have to capture practices, desires,
        ideas as well as networks and hierarchies of actants as they are
        about to develop new archival infrastructure. The actants that
        are involved in the realization and implementation are of
        special interests as they are epistemological bottlenecks, where
        all the former passes through and is formed into the PIA
        prototype.</p>
        <p>### Methods - Analyzing similar projects’ infrastructure and
        development processes (Comparison, Actor-Network-Theory) - ANT
        analysis - Expert interviews - Expert interviews with all human
        actants that are tasked with the conception and creation of
        (non-human actants) structures, tools, interfaces and so forth
        that constitute, shape, transform, read and write data in all
        it’s forms. - Mapping of the different forms data takes
        throughout it - Analyzing the different models for shared data
        responsibilities - Analyzing the technical infrastructure and
        its influence on participation - Analysis of X examples of other
        comparable projects’ design and development and the emergence of
        affordances - Practice-based Research (prototype) - Documenting
        and analyzing the development process of all relevant actants
        (Process-documentation) - Participatory research with and
        through a community with a focus on the technical development of
        a digital image archive</p>
        <h2 id="relevance">Relevance</h2>
        <p>Generate knowledge about the infrastructure of a digital
        image archive from a multi-disciplinary perspective that
        includes anthropology, technological aspects as well as design
        research.</p>
        <p>Furthers the discourse on what constitutes inside/outside,
        which is a basic issue when regarding participatory approaches
        to digital image archives.</p>
        <p>This research proposal is considering expanding the current
        participatory approach towards community building. Thinking
        participatory on the level of infrastructure enables the project
        to exist sustainably. It opens the infrastructure to a community
        that can carry and support the project after the end of the
        project.</p>
