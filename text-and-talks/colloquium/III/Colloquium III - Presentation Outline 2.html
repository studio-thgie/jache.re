        <ul>
        <li>Intro
        <ul>
        <li>Changes in research approach and focus</li>
        <li>Research Plan</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Changes
        <ul>
        <li>want to address the changes since c2, especially the
        transformation of the underlying research approach</li>
        <li>until c2 i looked at electronics from an ecological
        perspective, intending to change the way we relate, respect and
        care for such devices</li>
        <li>rooted in own experience and work and driven by a desire to
        do better within my own professionality</li>
        <li>based on that i developed an interest in animism as a way of
        relating to things</li>
        <li>and after a moment or two i choose voice assistants as the
        object of study to test this approach upon</li>
        <li>until c2 the focus was very much within the context of
        entertainment and home automation where i also made most of my
        ethnographic research</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>The big question in the feedback was about the (social)
        relevance
        <ul>
        <li>in terms of relevance of studying voice assistants and
        regarding the possible forms of engagements and output</li>
        <li>already before c2 i was playing with the thought of looking
        into therapeutic applications of voice assistants to address the
        social relevance part</li>
        <li>an idea i didn’t pursue after having a talk with a person
        from the BFH Medical Informatics. he very much advise against
        such a thing. he said it’s not a fun market to enter on your own
        right now</li>
        <li>i picked up the idea after c2 again but under the aspect of
        assistive devices</li>
        <li>this initiative was sparked partially by my engagement with
        ontological design as well as post-phenomenology</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>next to a new round of literature review in terms of design
        and inclusion i also made a couple of additional Interviews with
        focus on how voiceassistants mediate our access to the world,
        especially for people with disabilities
        <ul>
        <li>[folie] head of technical projects at the SBV</li>
        <li>[folie] an aquintance wo has partial tetraplegia after an
        accident and is dependent on voice-assistive technologies</li>
        <li>[folie] a former Superflux designer who has a very critical
        approach to voice assistants in his project</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>out of this process I was able to reformulate the research
        approach and focus and i’m very happy with it like this</li>
        <li>Research plan
        <ul>
        <li>sketch for the research proposal, with points taken from the
        snf guide</li>
        <li>2.1 Current state of research in the research area
        <ul>
        <li>[slide] ven diagram intersection</li>
        <li>Human-computer interaction studies
        <ul>
        <li>User-Experience und -Interaction Design</li>
        <li>Conversation Design</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Disability studies und inclusive design
        <ul>
        <li>Ontological design</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>which previous findings are the starting point and basis for
        the planned investigations</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>good amount of research, often with an empiric approach and
        rooted in medical technology and information technology</li>
        <li>would love to make the link to a more design based approach
        <ul>
        <li>next to the discourse in design justice which needs to be
        considered there is also a discourse specifically on design and
        disability, ie</li>
        <li>Inklusion als Entwurf, Tom Bieling</li>
        <li>goes hand in hand with the theoretical approach that I’m
        suggesting</li>
        <li>[zusammenfassung buch abstrakt]</li>
        <li>what important, relevant research is currently underway in
        Switzerland and abroad
        <ul>
        <li>VA-People, Experiences, Practices, Routines (VA-PEPR)</li>
        <li>[zusammenfassung abstrakt]</li>
        <li>Use of voice assistants with voice-activated and
        voice-enabled devices in healthcare</li>
        <li>[zusammenfassung abstrakt]</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>where and why is there a need for research
        <ul>
        <li>gap inbetween medical tech and it and UX understood as the
        design of grafical UIs</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, I am much more interested in the ontological
        dimension of voice assistants as assitive devices.</li>
        <li>[slide] ven diagram gap</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>2.2 Status of own research</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>my research shows that manufacturers have a limited view on
        user experience and that an expension of ontological design can
        be helpful. i base this hypothesis on my ethnographic research
        with vas within the context of entertainment</li>
        <li>Reference of a position; ontological design,
        post-phenomenology</li>
        <li>worked out a process of deep reading user experience that
        can be analysed within a postphenomenological approach regarding
        design questions</li>
        <li>additional to the design perspective i have a quite
        extensive knowledge and skill in terms of the underlying
        technologies which is a very valuable assets and brings with it
        a unique perspective
        <ul>
        <li>2.3 Objectives, data and methods
        <ul>
        <li>2.3.1 Forschungsfrage
        <ul>
        <li>How must voice assistants and the interaction with them be
        designed so that these technologies become a disability-first
        interface for people with visual or mobility impairments?</li>
        <li>How must voice assistants be designed so that people with
        disabilities can actively shape their lives with their
        help?</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>2.3.2 Hypotheses and assumptions</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Voice assistant technologies up to date are primarily a
        workaround to make lifeworlds, content or processes designed for
        able-bodied and neuro typical people accessible to people with
        disabilities.</li>
        <li>my hypothesis then is, that VAs have what they need to be a
        first-class interface for people with disabilities</li>
        <li>I bespoke such a hypothesis with the head of tech projects
        at the SBV and he agreed with me from a position of personal
        experience and professionall expertise - 2.3.4 Concrete
        objectives</li>
        <li>In addition to the scientific analysis and publication, the
        materialised output should be a digital guide for designing
        voice assistants or functionalities for people with
        disabilities.</li>
        <li>low-threshold access guide for interested parties,
        especially for designers and institutions that are active in
        this field</li>
        <li>the guide will include tutorials and technological
        fragments, like code examples and blueprints and be published
        under an opensource license</li>
        <li>as such, the guide can be built upon in practice as well as
        in further research projects
        <ul>
        <li>2.4 Timetable and milestones
        <ul>
        <li>Phase 1 - Literature study; 6 months</li>
        <li>Phase 2 - Qualitative evaluation and needs analysis; 6
        months</li>
        <li>Phase 3 - Workshop series / focus group / prototyping; 12
        months</li>
        <li>Phase 4 - Evaluation and finalisation; 6 months</li>
        <li>Phase 5 - Publication; 6 months</li>
        <li>I’m not quite sure about the length of the first two phases,
        but i guess we can talk about that in q&amp;a</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>2.5 Relevance of the research work</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Scientific relevance
        <ul>
        <li>focus on essential knowledge for design discourse on
        disabilities as well as human computer interaction</li>
        <li>adding depth to the discourse on user-experience design</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Social relevace
        <ul>
        <li>focus on essential knowledge on the design and development
        of assistive voice assistants which can be used in political or
        activist projects as well design studios</li>
        <li>representational character for disability discourses in
        design and human-computer interaction</li>
        <li>curb effect</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Budget and Funding Possibilities</li>
        <li>budget as suggested according to doc.ch, but as I don’t
        think i’ll be funded through that scheme, given my age and
        unacademic career, I also thought about alternatives</li>
        <li>Alternative PhD Programms: Make Sense PhD Program
        (https://makesensephd.ch/#/project?id=8)</li>
        <li>Get fragments of the projects funded or supported
        <ul>
        <li>through tech-Partners: SBV, caru-care</li>
        <li>call for projects or maybe even a residency
        <ul>
        <li>https://frh-fondation.ch/de/innovation-booster/</li>
        <li>https://www.janvaneyck.nl/</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Q&amp;A</li>
        <li>current situation; 60% - 70%</li>
        <li>could you give me any recommendation in terms of pre-study
        formats and fundings or other ways of furthering this
        project</li>
        <li>what kind of funding formats for the whole enterprise or
        parts of it could you recommend besides the provided,
        residencies, php programs, partial project funding</li>
        <li>applied methodology, since I missed a large part of the
        design research course, I sometimes have the feeling that I’m
        missing something here, but not exactly what. Could you tell me
        if you think it’s feasable or can you give me few hooks that I
        definitly shoudl follow up until the thesis?</li>
        <li>machen 3 jahre sinn oder soll ich besser auf 4
        ausweiten</li>
        <li>do you have the feeling that the part on participatory
        workshops need to be fleshed out a bit more?</li>
        </ul>
