        <p>So here is the thing. For the last 19 years I was battling
        with dept. Three years ago I finally found the strength and the
        support of an organisation which helped me with a plan and the
        organisation to pay of that pile of money I owed.</p>
        <p>All these years I got the strongest support from partners and
        friends and family and I’m really thankful for that. But I have
        to admit, that since getting the notification that we’re
        finished paying of after three years of a tight budget, it just
        occurred to me what kind of existential burden this was to me
        and those around me… and what a relief this is now.</p>
        <p>I guess it is kind of a coping mechanism to not occupy
        yourself to much with it. Otherwise the sheer weight of it might
        bring you to a halt. Dept is a crippling thing. You ought to
        work, you ought to pay of. You ought to behave or else you’ll be
        put in existential jeopardy. Even now I still believe it was
        solely my fault. It was kind of the thing that defined me or my
        freedom of expression, even if it wasn’t really visible.</p>
        <p>I was dependent on social welfare for a while. Which was
        actually one of the better experiences. I had the change to meet
        people and do things that I wouldn’t otherwise. My work
        <em>Liturgy for Electronic Waste</em> kind of grew out of
        that.</p>
        <p>But after all, I was extremely lucky - not only to get the
        right kind of support, but also to have been born in colour and
        shape that enabled my financial trajectory to become better. It
        wasn’t easy, but I weep at the though of all those who are
        without even the slightest possibility to get a stable
        self-deciding position just because they’re born in the “wrong“
        body, culture or class.</p>
        <p>A person in financial depts is a chained person - a society
        chained in depts is stalled from living its potentiality.</p>
        <p>&lt;3 much love to everybody who walked with me in this</p>
