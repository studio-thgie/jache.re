        of curiosity.</h1>
        <p>Curiosity is a vice that has been stigmatized in turn by
        Christianity, by philosophy, and even by a certain conception of
        science. Curiosity is seen as futility. However, I like the
        word; it suggests something quite different to me. It evokes
        “care”; it evokes the care one takes of what exists and what
        might exist; a sharpened sense of reality, but one that is never
        immobilized before it; a readiness to find what surrounds us
        strange and odd; a certain determination to throw off familiar
        ways of thought and to look at the same things in a different
        way; a passion for seizing what is happening now and what is
        disappearing; a lack of respect for the traditional hierarchies
        of what is important and fundamental. I dream of a new age of
        curiosity.</p>
