        <p>“being goblin is a way of flagging that you want to include
        people not in spite of their sloppiness and uneven emotional
        growth, but because of it – because goblins come as they are,
        and they grow in community with one another. Being goblin means
        being intergenerational in an un-precious way. It means that
        kids are a part of community, that their messes and tantrums and
        experiments and giggles all take place between our feet. It’s
        about acknowledging disability and madness and trauma in a way
        that removes normalcy as our baseline. Every body is a weird
        body and weird is good. Accommodating one another’s weirdness
        isn’t just worthwhile and important, and it’s not useful to
        frame it as noble or anything like that. Accommodating one
        another’s weirdness is the literal basis of goblin community.
        It’s how you nest, it’s how you romp, it’s what goblins always
        and necessarily do.” - <em>Avery Alder</em></p>
