        exposure</h1>
        <p>Societies: Secrecy and exposure I. Diamonds The world of
        diamonds is one of secrets. It starts with the annihilation of
        individuality. There is a generally accepted and executed dress
        code, but it certainly doesn’t suite everyone. Or better said,
        not everyone has the time and interest to explore the limits of
        such a restriction and play with it. Most people just don’t want
        to expose themselves with inappropriate clothing.</p>
        <p>Diamond merchants use their own secret language. They have
        special keywords to describe their goods, which are not
        accessible for the common people. And that sign language speaks
        of another fact: If you don’t understand this, we’re not
        interested in you.</p>
        <p>Generally, they don’t expose themselves bluntly. They wait
        for you in their little booth, because they know they have the
        stuff you need. II. Watch Brands A watch is a watch is a watch.
        It measures the time and sometimes includes some extended
        functionality. Watch brands suffer the same capitalistic
        sickness as cigarette brands: Why choose one offer the
        other?</p>
        <p>That’s why a watch has to tell a story. It has to create a
        mood for it’s clients. Speaking of clients, you’ll find much
        more characters in this hall then in the last. Here you find the
        people with resources and the will for individuality. These
        watch brands create their own worlds of nostalgia, art or
        technocracy. They make you feel special and unique and if you’re
        special enough to get access to their secret domes. Everybody
        can have a look at the shiny facades and who goes in and out,
        but not everybody can join the party. III. Hall of Universe The
        Hall of Universe was the “China Town” of Basel World. I would
        not have been surprised to find an asian food street vendor
        around any corner in this little mace of booth’ and people.</p>
        <p>I say shanzai at it’s best. Shanzai is the chinese culture of
        copying culture. And they don’t feel the urge to hide it either.
        The fair was colorful, noisy and absolutely alive. The products
        where not meant for an upper class client, but as a proof of
        concept: We can do that to!</p>
        <p>I felt at ease and the most comfortable here, even could get
        some strength back that I lost in the halls before. No need to
        expose yourself other then with facts.</p>
