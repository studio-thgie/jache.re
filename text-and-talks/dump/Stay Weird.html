        <p>I’ve spent nearly two decades trying to consume the most
        fringy kind of knowledge. I dabbled in magic, zen and
        biohacking, I tried to dissect my brain and ghost with
        psychedelics, I’ve become a multi-species advocate and
        interested in the philosophy of every single thing in the
        universe … I even played Dungeon&amp;Dragons.</p>
        <p>I worked as a clerk and accountant, software developer,
        academic, as a recycler of electronic waste, barkeeper, in a
        gallery and a library and as event organizer and curator.</p>
        <p>So what’s left?</p>
        <p>I still go to work 42.5 hours per week. I still eat and shit
        on a daily basis. I’m still worried on how I’m perceived by my
        peers.</p>
        <p>I’m a lump of bacteria, space dust and smartish matter,
        trying to have a optimistic-nihilistic attitude towards
        existence, blipping through this universe, which might be one of
        infinite possibilities or a really just a good simulation.</p>
        <p>Stay weird.</p>
