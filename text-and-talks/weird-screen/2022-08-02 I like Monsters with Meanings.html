        <h1 id="monsters-with-meanings">Monsters with meanings</h1>
        <p>The 21st edition of NIFFF in 2022 was my fourth time I went to binge-watch the strange and lovely movies that are not shown in your everyday cinema. It’s a wonderful tradition to start the summer, initiated by my cinephile partner. I can think of no better way to start the heavy-heat season as by hanging in the festival-center, swimming in the lake and of course watch tons of horrifying, slashy, weird and fantastic movies.</p>
        <p>There is one movie in particular that stuck with me and in the following I will attempt to read into it through a comparison with an another flic i saw some years ago. The movies in question are Men and Muere, Muonstro, Muere and the reading will be about what monsters can signify. But first we need to cover just a slight amount of theory. Monsters are not just nice gadgets to get some gore on screen, they quite often actual mean something. Monsters are not fabulated out of plain air, but often woven out of the background of our respective cultures. As such, monsters mirror our fears and the things we can’t categorize.</p>
        <h2 id="the-theory">The theory</h2>
        <p>I’ll take bits and pieces from the Master in Arts thesis by Julia Geiser. In her thesis-project Monsters and Others<a href="/text-and-talks/weird-screen/2022-08-02 I like Monsters with Meanings.html#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> she worked on monsters in illustration and how they relate to gender <span class="citation" data-cites="geiserjuliaMonstersOthers2018">[@geiserjuliaMonstersOthers2018]</span>.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>“And when they come back, they bring not just a fuller knowledge of our place in history and the history of knowing our place, but they bear selfknowledge, human knowledge – and a discourse all the more sacred as it arises from the outside. These monsters ask us how we perceive the world, and how we have misrepresented what we have attempted to place. They ask us to reevaluate our cultural assumptions about race, gender, sexuality, our perception of difference, our tolerance towards its expression. They ask us why we have created them.” <span class="citation" data-cites="cohenMonsterTheoryReading1996">[@cohenMonsterTheoryReading1996]</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Writers sometimes put little thought into their creations. They follow an inspiration and built up their own worlds and myth. Psychoanalysis has another take on this http://outtakemag.co.uk/features/2020/05/07/horror-monsters-psychoanalysis/</p>
        <h2 id="spoilers-ahead">Spoilers ahead</h2>
        <p>You’ve been warned.</p>
        <p>In the movie Men the protagonist Harper Marlowe, played by Jessie Buckley, rents a idyllic and spacious house in the english countryside. She needs to retreat after a traumatic experience, where her former partner commited suicide. During her brief stay she encounters a good handful of personas<a href="/text-and-talks/weird-screen/2022-08-02 I like Monsters with Meanings.html#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> which all share in common a trait of toxic masculinity. The effect is highten by the fact, that all of these characters are played by one actor, Rory Kinnear as Geoffrey. The best part yet is, that all these personas are seemingly expressed by the Green Man<a href="/text-and-talks/weird-screen/2022-08-02 I like Monsters with Meanings.html#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

        <p>Then https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/men-explained-sheela-na-gig-green-man-alex-garland https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2022-05-20/men-explained-a24-horror-alex-garland-jessie-buckley https://www.slashfilm.com/907127/mens-green-man-design-left-no-room-for-compromise/</p>
        <p>After this excursion I want to directing the gaze to another film that I admired a lot, the argentinian monster-flic Muere, Muonstro, Muere. I saw this movie at the NIFFF 2018 and it fascinates me up to it his day. I will again, be warned, spoil the film in the coming sentences. The story is straight forward. Mysterious murders are happening in a remote region of the Andes of Argentina. Women are found dead, decaptivated and raped. The story follows a police man, trying to solve the case, slowely decending into madness. That’s the gist of it. The movie is slow and developing, with beautiful scenery and weirdness in between. The murderer isn’t revealed until the very end of the movie, just hinted at in a handful of scenes beforehand.</p>
        <p>You’ll get why I pulled out Julia Geiser’s work on gender in monster illustration in a moment. The perpetrator, the monster, is a amalgation of a vagina dentata and a tentacle penis, formed into a slow walking, leathry gential sack.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>https://archive.org/details/muere-monstruo-muere-2018</li>
        <li>https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muere,_monstruo,_muere</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Both settings in rural environments, with a certain slowness, but with deep rooted evils</p>
        <p>Fighting my way through english and spanish reviews and blog entry the monster itself is never really taken up.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>No vamos a perder el tiempo en enumerar las torpes alegorías (sexuales, psicológicas, etc.) que <strong>Muere, monstruo, muere</strong> escupe sobre el espectador (basta ver la constitución del monstruo y el plano final de la película), los roles carentes de sentido de varios personajes o la espantosa solemnidad de todo el asunto. https://asalallena.com.ar/critica-muere-monstruo-muere-pedro-seva-2/</p>

        </ul>
        <p>So when you enjoy a monster-flic next time, think about what that monster actually means, not only how many people it kills in what fantastic ways.</p>
